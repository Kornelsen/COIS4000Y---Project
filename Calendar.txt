MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT

Dear Trent Students,
I am pleased to take a moment to personally welcome you
to Trent University. Congratulations on your decision to join
a vibrant community of students, faculty, and staff! We
are here to help you excel—personally, professionally, and
academically.
	 For over 50 years Trent University has challenged
students to think critically. We develop leaders who will
shape our future. As a member of our community you join
our past students. They include famous authors, Nobel Prize
winners, business leaders, and alumni who have enjoyed
successful careers in government, law, teaching, science,
and a host of other professions.
	 I invite you to take advantage of the offerings at our Peterborough and Durham – GTA
campuses. Please think about expanding your education through one of the many Study
Abroad options offered through Trent International. We are here to help your own story
unfold.
	 You are fortunate to join the Trent community at an exciting time, as we continue to
transform student life on campus. Our Peterborough campus is growing, and will continue
to grow while you are here. This fall we’ll open the doors to our brand new Student
Centre which will offer students new places and opportunities to socialize, learn, study
and engage in life on campus. Along with the excitement of the Student Centre, Trent’s
iconic Bata Library will be undergoing a major revitalization project which will transform it
into a library of the future. Our Durham – GTA campus will also continue to expand with a
number of new programs in collaboration with the Durham community, and a new master
plan that envisions an expanded campus for the future.
	 This calendar will serve as a reference to the many programs, courses, opportunities,
and services that are available to you. It will contribute to your success as a student here.
I invite you to step outside of your comfort zone, and jump at the new opportunities that
will present themselves to you during your time at Trent. Explore a variety of disciplines,
inquire and engage with our award-winning faculty, contribute to conversations at your
college or campus, and consider giving back to the communities in which you live and
learn.
	 The Trent University community offers a learning environment where debate, discussion,
and collaboration are encouraged. I’m delighted you have chosen to become a part of it.

Leo Groarke, PhD
President & Vice-Chancellor

Protection of Personal Information

Applicants and Prospective Students
Trent University may collect and use personal information
from prospective students to communicate with them
about University programs, process applications,
determine eligibility for admission and student awards,
administer surveys, research enrolment issues, and
maintain related statistical data.
Current Students
Once admitted and enrolled in an academic program,
a student’s information is used by the University to
deliver academic and administrative programs and
services. This includes but is not limited to: recording
academic progress, creating the permanent student
record, providing financial aid, delivering student
services, conducting program reviews/appraisals, and
communicating with students regarding University
business. Personal information may also be used by the
University, its authorized agents, approved researchers,
and/or the provincial and federal government for
statistical research purposes.
	 Trent University is required to disclose personal
information such as Ontario Education Numbers, student
characteristics, and educational outcomes to the Minister
of Advanced Education and Skills Development under s.
15 of the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities
Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter M.19, as amended. The
ministry collects this data for purposes such as planning,
allocating, and administering public funding to colleges,
universities, and other post-secondary educational
and training institutions and to conduct research and
analysis, including longitudinal studies, and statistical
activities conducted by or on behalf of the ministry for
purposes that relate to post-secondary education and
training. Further information on how the minister of
Advanced Education and Skills Development uses this
personal information is available on the ministry’s website:
ontario.ca/page/ministry-advanced-education-andskills-development (English) or www.ontario.ca/fr/
page/ministere-de-lenseignement-superieur-et-de-laformation-professionnelle (French),or by writing to
the Director, Post-secondary Finance and Information
Management Branch, Post-secondary Education Division,
7th Floor, Mowat Block, 900 Bay Street, Toronto, ON M7A
1L2.
	 Students who hold a graduate teaching assistantship or
other position covered by the Canadian Union of Public
Employees (CUPE II) are, by nature of their employment,
members of CUPE Local 3908. The University provides the
names and trentu.ca email addresses of these students to
CUPE for the purpose of communications related to the
student’s membership in the union.

	 The University may disclose limited and specific student
information to its recognized student government
associations (Trent Central Student Association, Trent
Graduate Student Association, Trent Durham Student
Association, and Trent-Fleming Nursing Students’
Association) for the purposes of administering their
membership programs, elections, and health plans. For
student health benefit plans, the sponsoring association
securely transfers the name, sex, date of birth, student
number, and in some cases the trentu.ca email address,
of eligible student members to its health benefits provider
and carrier to enable them to establish eligibility, grant
access to the benefits portal, and verify the identity of
students enrolled in the health plan. The University may
provide the names of college members to college cabinets
for member identification purposes.
	 Where students are enrolled in collaborative academic
programs, Trent University may be required to transfer
personal information to another post-secondary
institution. Wherever possible, students will be provided
with a separate notice explaining any information-sharing
required to jointly administer their program. Information
relating to academic integrity misconduct (e.g.,
falsification of documents) may be shared with other postsecondary educational institutions. Select information may
be shared with government funding agencies to process
financial assistance applications, with collection agencies
for outstanding accounts, and with contracted service
providers acting on behalf of the University. Credit card
information is transferred to an independent processing
company in order to process payments.
	 To the extent permitted by the Ontario Freedom of
Information and Protection of Privacy Act, personal
information may be disclosed to law enforcement
agencies. The University may also be required to
contact an appropriate third party about a student
in compassionate circumstances or in compelling
circumstances affecting the health or safety of an
individual or group.
	 Information regarding graduation and graduation
awards is made public at the time of convocation. The
name, year, and program of award winners may be shared
with donors, and academic awards and scholarships may
be celebrated within the University community.
	 Limited student personal information, including name,
sex, date of birth, home address, email, and phone
number of students registered at Trent University Durham,
is provided on a confidential basis to the City of Oshawa
– Recreation & Culture Services for the sole purpose
of confirming eligibility of, and managing registration
for, athletics fitness membership under the terms and
conditions of multi-year fitness membership agreement
between the Trent Durham Student Association (TDSA)
and the Corporation of the City of Oshawa.

Notification of Collection, Use, and Disclosure of
Personal Information
Students’ personal information is collected, used, and
disclosed by Trent University under the authority of
Section 18(3)(c) of The Trent University Act, 1962-63.

Notification of Use and Disclosure of Personal
Information to Statistics Canada
Statistics Canada is the national statistical agency. As
such, Statistics Canada carries out hundreds of surveys
each year on a wide range of matters including education.
It is essential to be able to follow students across
time and institutions to understand, for example, the
factors affecting enrolment demand at post-secondary
institutions. The increased emphasis on accountability for
public investment means that Statistics Canada regularly
asks all colleges and universities to provide data on
students and graduates.
	 The Federal Statistics Act provides the legal authority for
Statistics Canada to obtain access to personal information
held by educational institutions. The information may be
used only for statistical purposes and the confidentiality
provisions of the Statistics Act prevent the information
from being released in any way that would identify a
student.
	 Students who do not wish to have their information
used are able to ask Statistics Canada to remove their
identification and contact information from the national
database. Further information on the use of this
information can be obtained from Statistics Canada’s
website: statcan.gc.ca or by writing to the Post-secondary
Section, Centre for Education Statistics, 17th Floor, R.H.
Coats Building, Tunney’s Pasture, Ottawa, ON, K1A 0T6.
	 Questions on how student information is collected,
used, or disclosed to Statistics Canada, may be
directed to the University Registrar, Office of the
Registrar, Blackburn Hall, Trent University, 1600 West
Bank Drive, Peterborough, ON, K9L 0G2, or email:
registrar@trentu.ca.

Student Records Policies
Access to Student Record Policy
By applying for admission to Trent University and by
registering in programs or courses at the University,
students accept the University’s right to collect pertinent
personal and academic information. The information is
used to assess their qualifications for admission, establish
and update a record of their academic performance,
determine their eligibility for awards and scholarships,
determine government funding, and allow the University
to undertake its obligations under The Trent University
Act, 1962-63. For further information on the collection
and use of this information, or if you have concerns about
the collection and use of this information, please contact
the University Registrar at registrar@trentu.ca.
	 All documentation provided to the University to support
an application for admission, housing, financial awards,
or any petition or appeal becomes the property of the
University. The University Registrar, in the Office of the
Registrar, is the custodian of all official physical and
electronic academic records of all students who have
been or are currently registered in academic programs
at Trent University. The Office of the Registrar strives to
ensure the security and privacy of personal information
through the application of appropriate systems for access
to that information, the development of procedures, and
the education and training of staff and faculty to treat
personal information in confidence.

major programs. This regulation is not applicable to students enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Bachelor
of Education programs.
	 It is the responsibility of the student to consult the appropriate Academic Calendar(s) and to follow regulations and
requirements as stated. Students will have the opportunity to declare their calendar year when applying to graduate.
	 Ten years from the year of declared major, students who have not yet completed their degree and wish to do so must
follow the program requirements in the current year’s Academic Calendar. For the Nursing BScN degree, please see the
School of Nursing’s specific degree requirements.
University Degree Requirements
Students must satisfy the University Degree Requirements as published in the current Academic Calendar.
For requirements for the Consecutive Bachelor of Education program see p. 96. Requirements for all other programs

Requirement for a Minor
A minor is a prescribed set of at least 5.0 credits providing a secondary area of focus different from a student’s major. A
minor may only be completed as part of an Honours degree. Normally the requirements of a minor are the same as those
of the corresponding joint major general degree, and is offered only in subject areas in which a major exists. A minor will
be notated on the academic transcript but does not appear on the degree parchment. Students who have fulfilled the
requirements for a single-major or joint-major Honours degree may apply to the Office of the Registrar for a minor in a
different subject. See individual department and program entries for details.

Classics is the study of the ancient Greek and Roman
cultures (ca. 3000 BCE–476 CE), the two intertwined
civilizations that lie at the root of modern Western culture.
Figures of myth, great leaders, creators of profoundly
moving poetry and drama, great philosophers and artists
who produced some of the world’s most exquisite art
and architecture—from Homer to Alexander the Great,
from Julius Caesar to Constantine and beyond—the
legacies of these individuals have deeply influenced many
later ages and are still highly relevant today. We have
more evidence about the Greeks and Romans than most
other early cultures: poetry, plays, novels, prose treatises,
histories, vases, sculpture, architecture, inscriptions, and
papyri. At Trent, students can study ancient literature in
all its forms, the history of Greece and Rome, art history
and archaeology (including in ancient Egypt), myth and
religion, women in antiquity, philosophy, and classical
languages (Latin and ancient Greek).
Notes
•	 For the purposes of University regulations concerning
the maximum number of credits in a single discipline
(13.0 for Honours, 8.0 for General), Ancient Greek
& Roman Studies and Greek & Latin are considered
separate disciplines.
•	 Senior seminar courses are offered according to
faculty availability. Students may take more than one
such course in one year or in their overall program.
•	 Reading courses may be offered according to faculty
availability. Interested students should consult with
the program by March of the preceding year; see
trentu.ca/agrs/students_policy_readingcourse.php for
the policy and procedure. Students may take more
than one such course in their overall program.
•	 Students may also study Mediterranean archaeology
in field school courses offered by other Canadian and
non-Canadian universities for credit on a Letter of
Permission, with program approval.
•	 Students may obtain a major in Ancient Greek &
Roman Studies with a minor in Greek & Latin, but
no course in the major may be counted toward the
minor as well.

•	 Students considering graduate work in Ancient Greek
& Roman Studies are strongly advised to include as
many credits in Greek and Latin as possible in their
program (completion of a minor in Greek & Latin
is suggested) and to begin the study of German or
French as undergraduates.

Anthropology is the study of humankind. It is a discipline
integrating four subfields: archaeology, linguistic
anthropology, biological anthropology, and cultural
anthropology. Archaeologists recover material remains in
order to interpret past cultures. Linguists study languages
worldwide and in relation to society and culture.
Biological anthropologists investigate human origins,
growth, and development in relation to environmental,
genetic, and cultural factors. Cultural anthropologists
work with living groups worldwide, recording their
ways of life and beliefs and interpreting their findings
to better understand and explain the similarities and
differences among people. Anthropologists investigate
economic and social inequality; identity, ethnicity, and
nationalism; ethnocentrism and racism; gender and
society; the individual and society; the role of technology
and material culture; and tensions between global and
local perspectives. A constant and distinctive feature of

anthropology is its insistence upon the study of lived
experience, the anthropology of everyday life.

The Archaeology program is an interdisciplinary program
focused on the study of the human past through the
material record. Students will be exposed to comparative
world prehistory, archaeological field methods and
laboratory techniques, and the archaeology of specific
regions (Old World and New World). Degree options
provide students with basic training in the practical
and theoretical aspects of archaeological research in
Anthropology and in Classics. Current areas of academic
expertise are the archaeology, ancient art, and architecture
of the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the pre-Classical and
Classical Mediterranean world.
Notes
•	 Students are strongly advised to plan course selection
carefully in order to acquire needed prerequisites and
to prepare for graduate school or careers in different
specialties. Advising information is available on the
Archaeology program website.
•	 Students are required to gain relevant archaeological
field and/or laboratory experience. They are
encouraged to take one of two existing field courses,
ANTH 3000Y or ANTH-AHCL 3850Y, which are
normally offered in the summer. Those who are
unable to take one of these courses may substitute
ANTH 3151H and 3152H, which are normally offered
during the regular school year. Alternatively, students
may register in a field school or lab methods course at
another university by obtaining a Letter of Permission
from the Office of the Registrar prior to registering
in the course. See Letters of Permission (p. 295) for
additional details.

•	 Students who already have extensive field and/
or laboratory experience (such as from previous
archaeological employment) should consult with the
program coordinator, who may consider waiving
the degree requirement for a field or lab course. At
a minimum, students would normally have to have
the equivalent of four weeks of full-time work in the
field and/or lab (i.e., 160 hours total). If such a waiver
is approved, the student will need to substitute an
additional course, with the coordinator’s approval, in
order to meet the total number of required courses.
•	 Courses fulfilling University science course
requirements for the BSc are marked “(Sc)” in the
individual course descriptions.
•	 Courses fulfilling the core specified credits of
the degree may not simultaneously satisfy the
distributional requirements related to Categories A–D.
•	 A minimum grade of 60% in INDG 1001H and
1002H (or 1000Y) and in two of ANTH-AHCL 1030H
(or AHCL 1001H), ANTH 1001H, 1002H, 1010H,
or 1020H (or in ANTH 1000Y) is required for the
Honours BSc in Archaeology and the Honours BA
with a Specialization in Anthropological Archaeology.
A minimum grade of 60% in two of ANTH-AHCL
1030H (or AHCL 1001H), ANTH 1001H, 1002H,
1010H, or 1020H (or in ANTH 1000Y) is required
for the Honours BA with a Specialization in Classical
Archaeology.
•	 Students with an interest in Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) are recommended to incorporate the
Emphasis in Geographical Information Systems, a joint
program with Fleming College, into their program
(see p. 257).
•	 There is no joint-major program, General program, or
minor in Archaeology.

There is tremendous need for greater scientific literacy
on the part of students of the humanities and social
sciences, and in society as a whole. There is an equal need
for scientists who are able to think about the ethical,
political, and philosophical implications of their work,
and who understand social and humanistic perspectives
on knowledge. Improved communication, reflection,
and understanding by all parties would be an important
contribution to the development of responsible and
sustainable public policy and public discourse on topical
issues, including the creative arts. Graduates of the
Bachelor of Arts & Science (BAS) program will have the
ability to make this contribution.
	 Throughout the program, core courses are designed to
foster skills of inquiry, emphasizing critical thinking and
argument and culminating in applying learned skills in
research and the communication of research. In year one,
BAS students begin to build their understanding of the
methods used in humanities, science, and social sciences
disciplines. They formulate research questions, gather
evidence, and add insights from the various academic
disciplines to support the interpretation of evidence.
Year two allows students to continue honing their skills
in writing, speaking, and quantitative reasoning. Year
three offers the opportunity to explore how societal and
cultural forces both affect and shape inquiry. By year four,
students are poised to engage in student-driven research
under the supervision of a faculty member, integrating
methodologies and theoretical approaches acquired in the
core BAS courses.

Notes
•	 There is no joint-major or General degree program in
Arts & Science.
•	 Not all combinations of minors are possible. Students
will be contacted by the program coordinator to
schedule an advising session in their first week at
Trent.
• 	 All Trent minors are 5.0 credits except Computing
Systems (6.5–7.0) and Physics (7.0).
• 	 There is no minor in Archaeology, Biochemistry &

Social Work, Sustainable Agriculture & Food Systems,
or Water Sciences.
• 	 For students who entered the program prior to May
1, 2014, ASCI-PHIL 2780H with a minimum grade of
70% may be substituted for ASCI 2000H.
•	 Students should ensure that they have satisfied the
University degree requirement for at least 7.0 credits
at the 3000 level or beyond.
BACHELOR OF ARTS & SCIENCE PROGRAM
•	 In addition to the program requirements listed
below, students must satisfy the University degree

•	 A minimum grade of 70% in each of ASCI 1001H
and 1002H (or 1000Y), 2000H, and 3000H is required
for the degree.
•	 The same course may not simultaneously satisfy the
requirements of both minor subjects.

Admission Requirements
The Bachelor of Arts & Science is normally a directentry program with a limited number of student places,
although transfer students will be assessed on a caseby-case basis. Normally, students with an overall average
lower than 75% will not be admitted to the program.

Biology is the study of life at all levels of organization,
from molecular and cell to population and community.
Students who complete a single major in Biology will
have a broad introduction to these topics, along with
the opportunity to specialize in aspects of biology that
interest them in particular. Many courses provide an
opportunity for independent research projects. The
Biology Department offers two Specializations, one in
Conservation Biology, the other in Health Sciences. In
addition, the Biochemistry & Molecular Biology program
is shared with the Chemistry Department. Students may
choose to do joint-major degrees with other departments
or programs, including Environmental & Resource Science/
Studies, Chemistry, Geography, Anthropology, and
Psychology, among others.
Notes
•	 For fulfilling the University requirement of 1.0 credit
in Mathematics in the BSc program, the following
combinations are recommended: MATH 1110H and
1120H, 1051H and 1052H, or 1005H and 1550H.
•	 Transfer students should consult with the chair of the
department before selecting courses.
•	 Any course involving work with live vertebrate
animals requires the Animal Care Course, which is
described on p. 13 of the Calendar. The Animal
Care Course requirement is indicated in some course
descriptions, but may also apply to others. Check with
the Biology Office or course instructor if in doubt.
•	 Fees may be levied for field trips.
•	 Some courses that were previously offered at the
2000 level are now being offered at the 3000 level,
and vice versa. In each case, it is the level at which a
student took the course that will be considered when
calculating the number of credits beyond the 2000
level required for the student’s degree (7.0 for the
Honours degree, 4.0 for the General degree).
•	 Students may take a maximum of 1.0 credit in Biology
reading courses.
•	 It is recommended that courses taken in the fourth
year of the Honours program be beyond the 2000
level. 	
•	 Students intending to pursue graduate studies should
take BIOL 4010Y or 4020D.

We are entering a time during which our understanding
of the biology of life is expected to undergo profound
transformation due to the development of advanced
analytical techniques. Genetic and molecular techniques,
for example, have revealed a dynamic new understanding
of the interactions among molecules, cells, organisms,
and their communities and environments, and how
these interactions affect health and disease—bringing
together science disciplines in a way that has not yet
been conceived. Knowledge of basic biology is now the
foundation for the development of novel approaches in
the maintenance of a healthy functioning body and for
new treatments for disease. Students who complete the
Biomedical Science degree will appreciate that the many
approaches to health and medicine are complementary,
and will be able to apply the principles they have learned
to assess and solve problems as they relate to real-world
health issues. The program gives students training in
both practical and theoretical aspects of a diversity of
medically-related topics. A distinctive feature of the
program is the requirement that students intern with a
collaborating agency or individual sponsor in a health or
medical science setting.

The School of Business at Trent University offers a
four-year Honours program leading to a Bachelor of
Business Administration (BBA) degree. The program
enables students to develop an understanding of the
nature of organizational life, to communicate more
effectively, to learn the techniques of financial and
management accounting, and to gain knowledge of
managerial planning and strategy formation. In addition
to core business subjects, the program emphasizes
communication and creative problem-solving skills that
are essential to future career success. A strong emphasis
on group work provides an ideal environment in which to
practice these skills. An essential feature of the program
is its focus on the human side of organizations—to
recognize and value the people who actually make
organizations work. We encourage our students to
develop a broad base of knowledge, an understanding
of the larger social issues facing organizations, and the
capacity for critical analysis.

We teach students about the diverse, often contested
meanings of the Canadian experience and Canadian
citizenship. We explore how even as the transnational
attracts critical and public attention, the nation remains
the major administrative and imaginative unit organizing
people’s lives. Our focus, in research and in the classroom,
is on the Canadian nation in a global context. We offer
interdisciplinary courses in four areas: culture, literature,
and the arts; policy, economy, and society; identities and
social movements; and space, place, and region; while
encouraging thought about Canadian history, institutions,
ideology, and social justice.

The study of computing and information systems is
central to our understanding of how the world processes,
manages, and communicates information. It is a field
which impacts all disciplines and has redefined how we
work, interact, and conduct our day-to-day lives. The
Department of Computing & Information Systems offers
two streams of study: Computing Systems (major, jointmajor, and minor) and Information Systems (joint-major
and minor). Under the Computing Systems stream, three
specializations are also offered: Computer Science, Data
Analytics, and Software Engineering.
	 The computing systems specialist designs, implements,
and integrates software applications which may
execute on any system of computing devices, from
supercomputers to game boards. He or she uses theories,
methodologies, and techniques that help ensure that the
system is robust and useable. The information systems
specialist, on the other hand, is concerned with the flow,
storage, and access to information both within and across
organizational boundaries, encompassing systems that are
both computational and non-computational. He or she
requires a broad systems perspective and an appreciation
of both technical matters like databases, networks, and
telecommunications, as well as non-technical matters
such as ethics, law, and digital culture. The minor in
Computer Studies offers the study of computing from
a generalist point of view. This option may particularly
appeal to students in the humanities, liberal arts, teacher
education, or those with a general interest in computing.

Program Coordinator
O. Alam, BSc (King Abdulaziz), MSc (Queen’s), PhD
(McGill)
The software engineer works as part of a team to
design, implement, test, maintain, and document
software solutions. Because these solutions are typically
large and complex, the software engineer must deal
on several levels of abstraction and draw on sound
methodologies and practices to produce software which
is correct, robust, maintainable, and extensible. The
software engineer therefore bridges the gap between
the requirements of a client and the software solution
to meet those requirements. He or she must have not
only technical skills, but also interpersonal skills to work
within the dynamics of a group. The capstone of the
Specialization in Software Engineering is a full-year
team project (COIS 4000Y) which exercises all phases of
software development on a real-world application.
	 Students who have fulfilled the requirements for a
single-major Honours degree in Computing Systems may
apply for a Specialization in Software Engineering, if they
have also successfully completed the following 9.0 credits:
–	 4.0 COIS credits consisting of COIS 3030H, 3040H,
3050H, 3320H, 3420H, 3850H, and 4000Y
–	 1.0 credit from ADMN
–	 1.0 arts credit from AHCL, CAST, CUST, ENGL, FREN,
HIST, PHIL, SPAN or WMST
–	 1.0 science credit from BIOL, CHEM, ERSC, FRSC,
GEOG, or PHYS
–	 2.0 additional credits outside of COIS and MATH

The computer scientist studies and develops software
systems which interface most closely with the underlying
hardware. These systems are grounded in both
mathematical and non-mathematical paradigms such
as object-orientation, relations, and complexity theory.
Because the computer scientist bridges the gap between
software and hardware systems, he or she develops
applications which exploit the speed and power of digital
computation, designing new models of computation
and new methods of problem-solving. The Specialization
in Computer Science fully prepares students to pursue
graduate studies in both theoretical and applied computer
science.
	 Graduating students who have fulfilled the
requirements for a single-major Honours degree in
Computing Systems may apply for a Specialization
in Computer Science, if they have also successfully
completed the following 8.0 credits:
–	 3.0 COIS credits consisting of COIS 2320H, 3030H,
3050H, 3320H, 4050H, and 4100H

SPECIALIZATION IN DATA ANALYTICS
Program Coordinator
S. M. McConnell, BSc, MSc, PhD (Queen’s)
Today, there is a clear trend away from single-core
processors, even in contemporary desktop machines, and
toward the analysis of large datasets in the realm of Big
Data Science. The efficient analysis of large scientific and
retail datasets will require a generation of programmers,
analysts, and developers who are familiar with techniques
suitable for the analysis of Big Data. The Specialization
in Data Analytics provides a solid foundation in those
techniques, including parallel programming, visualization,
and predictive modelling.
	 Graduating students who have fulfilled the
requirements for a single-major Honours degree in
Computing Systems may apply for a Specialization in Data
Analytics, if they have also successfully completed the
following 3.5 credits:
–	 3.5 COIS credits consisting of COIS 3030H, 3510H,

visual art, music, and theatre that ground artistic
practices, products, and events in cultural, historical,
media, and political contexts. Small and intensive
art, theatre, and music workshop courses, taught
by practicing artists, are available to Cultural Studies
majors in each of these three areas (visual art, music,
theatre). Certain courses are counted as “teachables”
for Education students.
Specialization in Writing & Narrative
Courses in comparative literature that engage with
the relationships between narrative and culture, at the
level of storytelling in different media contexts (that
can include theatre, oral narrative, television, film),
in relation to historical contexts (such as modernism,
postmodernism, surrealism), or as engagements with
specific genres, such as science fiction, historical
fiction, utopian fiction, experimental fiction.
Specialization in Film, Video & Media
Courses in film, radio, television, popular culture, and
social/“new” media, that examine the specificities,
as well as the pervasive influences in culture, of each
medium, sometimes in direct comparison with each
other, and sometimes in the context of inquiry into
the theoretical and historical contexts of modern and
contemporary media. Small, intensive workshops
in film production are available to Cultural Studies
majors.
Specialization in Social Thought
Interdisciplinary, multimedia courses in social and
cultural theory that focus on engagements with
complex, contemporary themes, such as gender and
sexuality, the modern body, ideology, globalization,
technology, the senses, psychoanalysis, ethics, and
the law.

See faculty listings in Environment
Trent University, in collaboration with Fleming College,
offers a Joint Degree/Diploma in Ecological Restoration.
The Trent-Fleming Ecological Restoration degree/diploma
was created in response to growing global recognition
of environmental disturbance and the science of
remediation. Related to this is the need for a specialized
set of skills and knowledge in the environmental sector.
As an emerging field of expertise, ecological restoration
is learned by direct engagement in the recovery of
damaged and degraded ecosystems. The collaboration
between Trent and Fleming involves the sharing of faculty,
teaching, field study courses, applied projects, and
resources over the four years of the program. 
	 Students spend their first two years at Fleming
College’s School of Environmental and Natural Resource
Sciences in Lindsay, where they build science, planning,
and communications skills while practising ecological
restoration through field courses and project work.
Students then attend Trent University in Peterborough
for the final two years of the program, where they can
choose either to specialize or continue to balance theory
and practice in a more broad-based degree program.
	 Students graduate at the end of year four with both a
college diploma and university degree (BSc Honours) in
Ecological Restoration.
Academic Progression
To progress successfully to semester 2 of the joint
program, students must achieve a 65% grade in the
semester 1 courses Environmental Science I and Critical
Thinking and Communication.
	 To progress to year 3 of the program, students must
pass (50%) all courses and achieve a 70% overall program
average in years 1 and 2.

with problems of scarcity through a systematic and
logical framework for analyzing how a society solves
such problems as which goods and services to produce,
how to organize production, and for whom goods and
services are to be produced. Knowledge of economics
is necessary for understanding and dealing intelligently
with current topics like unemployment, economic growth,
income inequality, the environment, globalization, and
various forms of market regulation. Besides its importance
in understanding contemporary social issues, economics
is useful in developing career skills for business, law,
teaching, public administration, and research. Both verbal
and mathematical training are involved in the study of
economics.

Admission Criteria
This is a direct-entry program with a limited number
of student spaces. Admission decisions are based on
a combination of an applicant’s academic average (a
minimum of 75% is required on courses considered for
admission) and a supplemental application (Applicant
Profile). Applicant Profile forms can be accessed at
trentu.ca/education. As this is a limited enrolment
program, fulfillment of the minimum requirements does
not necessarily guarantee admission.

Entrance to the Trent University Consecutive Teacher
Education Program
A limited number of spaces in the Bachelor of Education
program are reserved each year for Teacher Education
Stream students. To be considered, students in the
Teacher Education Stream must make an application
through the Teacher Education Application Service

considered for admission on an individual basis.
	 All Teacher Education Stream students who are
interested in pursuing a Bachelor of Education degree
should review the admission requirements for the
Consecutive Bachelor of Education program (p. 96).
Successful Bachelor of Education applicants must
complete all Trent Honours degree requirements and
teaching division prerequisites by the May preceding

opportunities to study the environment, with more than
100 courses in all aspects of environmental science
and policy. Many of these courses emphasize practical
experience, including field work in Trent’s network of
nature areas and in local communities. Students can
choose to pursue an Honours BA in Environmental &
Resource Studies or an Honours BSc in Environmental
& Resource Science. Students may earn a single-major
or joint-major degree with any of more than 20 other
University departments or programs that offer Honours
degrees. The School also offers an Honours Bachelor of
Environmental Science/Studies (BESS). Students earning
a degree in another subject may also obtain a minor

Trent University’s Forensic Science Program offers two
degree options: a Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science
(BScFS) and a joint-major degree.
	 The Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science (BScFS)
is a direct-entry professional degree program with
a limited number of student places. This program
integrates the study of science and law with investigative
practice and theory. Students in Trent’s Forensic Science
degree program learn the foundational science of
forensics through the study of anthropology, biology,
and chemistry. These foundational science courses
complement the specialized forensics courses offered
in the program. The degree particularly emphasizes
emerging developments in DNA forensic applications and
crime scene investigation through courses in laboratory
techniques and related case work.
	 From the beginning of their forensic studies at Trent,
BScFS students are fully immersed in a functioning
forensic research and service environment located in
the DNA Building. Students practice case work, learn
team-building, analyze ethical and legal issues related
to evidence, and face the challenge of communicating
complex scientific evidence within the legal system.
Students in the program may also participate in a
placement/mentorship course where they gain valuable
“real-world” experience and begin to develop their
professional network.
	 The joint-major degree option offered by the Forensic
Science Program can be taken in conjunction with other
departments or programs including, but not limited to,
Biology, Psychology, Chemistry, Computing & Information
Systems, Physics, and Anthropology. Students enrolled
in the joint-major program can enrol in a number of the
same courses that are provided to BScFS students and
have the option of obtaining either an Honours Bachelor
of Science (BSc) or an Honours Bachelor of Arts (BA)
degree.

Admission Requirements
The BScFS is a direct-entry program with a limited number
of student places. A secondary school diploma and six
Ontario U/UM credits including one 4U credit in each of
Chemistry, Biology, English, and Mathematics are required
for admission. 4U Physics is highly recommended.
Normally, students with an overall average lower than
75% will not be admitted to the program.
	 For students in the joint-major Honours program, see
General Admission Requirements in the Calendar.

The Gender & Women’s Studies Department explores
gender relations and women’s experiences across cultures
and nations, throughout history, and in contemporary
societies. We examine how gender relations and ideas
about gender shape every site of human interaction, from
the personal to the institutional, the local to the global.
Gender relations and gendered identities are understood

in constant interaction with other important social,
economic, and cultural categories and hierarchies, such
as class, race, ability, and sexuality. Courses investigate a
broad range of issues, including how media and popular
culture can be both problematic and empowering for
girls and women; how feminist scholars and activists are
critiquing public policies in health, social welfare, and
education; how globalization is gendered; how dominant
institutions like the family, schools, and the state shape
social identities and opportunities; how women’s and
other social movements in the past and present challenge
inequalities and envision peace and justice.
	 As an interdisciplinary department, Gender &
Women’s Studies draws on theoretical perspectives and
methodologies from a wide range of fields such as History,
Political Studies, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology,
English Literature, Indigenous Studies, Cultural Studies,
International Development Studies, Canadian Studies, and
the natural sciences. We combine theory with empirical
research, foster critical thinking, and encourage students’
involvement with local and broader communities.

The Trent School of the Environment offers BA and BSc
programs in Geography. Students may earn a singlemajor or joint-major degree with a wide range of other
University departments or programs. Students earning a
degree with a major in another subject may also obtain a
minor in Geography. The program has a strong emphasis
on field-based learning and interdisciplinary study.
Many courses are cross-listed with other departments
and programs, including an Emphasis in Geographical
Information Systems linked with Fleming College.
Students in the Honours program are encouraged to
explore the thesis and community-based research options
as valuable training for postgraduate studies and jobrelated experience.

BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE
PROGRAMS IN GEOGRAPHY

below, students must satisfy the University degree
requirements (see p. 11).
•	 The same course may not simultaneously satisfy
the requirements of both programs in a joint-major
degree.
•	 The same course may not satisfy more than one
category requirement.
•	 Students who have successfully completed PSYC
2019H (or both 2016H and 2017H) are exempt from
the GEOG 2080H requirement for the joint-major
or minor in Geography. This exemption will not,
however, alter the minimum number of credits in
Geography required for the degree.
•	 Students who have taken MATH 1052H (or 1050Y)
and achieved a grade of at least 75% are exempt
from taking GEOG 2080H, and from the GEOG
2080H prerequisite for other Geography courses.
This exemption will not, however, alter the minimum
number of credits in Geography required for the

check individual course descriptions for prerequisites.
•	 Some courses at the 3000 level are offered in
alternate years.
•	 Courses in Geography fulfilling University science
course requirements for the BSc are marked “(Sc)” in
the individual course descriptions.
•	 Students with an interest in Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) are recommended to incorporate the
Emphasis in Geographical Information Systems, a joint
program with Fleming College, into their Honours
program. For students pursuing the GIS Emphasis,
the category requirements in the single-major BA and
BSc are different, but the total number of Geography
credits required for the degrees is the same.

Indigenous Environmental Studies/Science at Trent
University is an innovative and multidisciplinary program
offered jointly by the School of the Environment and the
Chanie Wenjack School for Indigenous Studies. It brings
together principles of both Indigenous knowledge and
Western science. Instruction integrating these approaches
will provide students with the necessary knowledge and
skills, including both critical and integrative thinking
abilities, to begin to address the complex environmental
problems facing Indigenous communities, governments,
business, industry, research, and society in general.
The foundation upon which the program is based
recognizes both the strengths and limitations of any
single perspective, and seeks to develop interactive and
integrative thinking to address environmental, health, and
social issues. Learning and problem-solving are focused
on benefiting both Indigenous and non-Indigenous
communities.

Indigenous Studies is a multi-disciplinary examination,
analysis, and reflection upon Indigenous experiences in
Canada and around the world. This exploration, based in
Western and Indigenous epistemologies, aims to develop
a more complex understanding of this experience in its
many dimensions: political, economic, social, cultural,
and spiritual. The Chanie Wenjack School for Indigenous
Studies offers a wide variety of courses allowing students
to explore a particular aspect of this experience as well
as opportunities for studying their interrelatedness.
The knowledge gained forms a foundation for working
more effectively with Indigenous peoples. The School
also collaborates with the School of Business through
the Specialization in Niigaaniiwin—The Art of Leading
and with the School of the Environment in offering the
Indigenous Environmental Studies/Science program.

Normally students choose a program of study determined
by the academic regulations leading to a major or jointmajor in Arts or Science. In exceptional circumstances,
students of superior academic ability and intellectual
independence may design an individualized program of
study, selecting courses from various disciplines to explore
a theme of their own choosing. Before designing such
a program, students are encouraged to speak with an
Academic Advisor about their personal academic goals
(see Academic Advising, p. 319).
	 The following guidelines apply:
•	 This program is intended for students who have given
evidence of superior academic ability and intellectual
independence, and is normally available only as an
Honours degree.
•	 The Individualized Studies program consists of 20.0
credits of which at least 2.0 must be at the 4000
level. A minimum cumulative average of 75% should
normally be maintained.
•	 Students must apply for the program through an
Academic Advisor. The application must include a
rationale for the choice of courses, including reasons
why the proposed program of study cannot be
accommodated within an existing major or jointmajor program, and must identify the remaining
courses required.
•	 Students must discuss the intended program with
an Academic Advisor before the end of the first year
of studies. Students who have completed 5.0 credits
may be considered retroactively for an Individualized
Studies program.
•	 The Academic Advisor will: ensure that the program
meets the University’s degree requirements, ensure
that the student has obtained approval from the
academic departments or programs concerned,

Program Coordinator

(International Institute of Social Studies), PhD (York)
The joint-major Honours program in International Political
Economy (IPE) is offered by the Department of Political
Studies and is intended for students with an interest
in the interconnected nature of the study of politics
and economics at the international and global levels,
which they wish to explore while pursuing a joint-major
Honours option in another discipline or program. The
rise of the global South, the worsening of inequalities,
the displacement of workers through outsourcing and
robotics, financialization, a resurgence of nationalist social
forces have raised the prominence of the study of IPE in
recent years among scholars and students from a wide
variety of academic backgrounds. IPE merges Political
Studies with Economics and International Development
Studies, as well as Anthropology, English Literature,
Environmental & Resource Science/Studies, Gender &
Women’s Studies, History, and Indigenous Studies.

■■Journalism

Program Coordinator
To be named
The Trent/Loyalist Journalism program allows students
to build a foundation in critical and analytical thinking,
ethical awareness, and journalistic practice, while
pursuing discipline-based study in a field of choice.
	 From September to April in years 1 and 2, and from
September to December in year 3, students are based at
Trent to complete the Journalism core courses as well as
many of their joint-major discipline requirements. In each
of years 1 and 2, students take a Journalism course that
is included in the block transfer earned from Loyalist. In
the summers following years 2 and 3, students attend
an intensive six-week Journalism program at Loyalist
College in Belleville, developing knowledge and skills in
civic literacy, journalistic writing styles, media production,
design and performance, with opportunities to apply
their discipline-based studies from Trent (see notes). From
January in year 3 through year 4, students continue the
Journalism curriculum at Loyalist. If required, students may
take additional Trent electives or discipline-based courses
in the summers following years 1 to 3. The final year is
an integrated year in which students, though based at
Loyalist, develop a capstone project that meets both the
Trent joint-major discipline requirement for a major project
or thesis at the Honours level and Loyalist’s requirements
for enterprise journalism.
	 Students graduate with a Trent Honours joint-major
degree, an advanced diploma in Journalism—Online,
Print and Broadcast from Loyalist, and a comprehensive
portfolio of work that demonstrates job-ready skills. The
program concludes with an eight-week field placement
in a professional broadcast, print, or online newsroom or
related setting.
Notes
•	 In addition to the program requirements listed
below, students must satisfy the University degree
requirements (see p. 11).
•	 The same course may not simultaneously satisfy the
requirements of both programs in the joint-major
degree. Students are strongly advised to plan course
selection carefully in order to meet this regulation,
particularly in year 1 of the program. Advising
information is available through the Journalism Office.
•	 Journalism offers a direct-entry joint-major Honours
program only—there is no General program, singlemajor Honours program, or minor.
•	 In year 1 and year 2 of the program, students will be
automatically registered in a 0.5-credit Loyalist course,
taught at Trent’s Symons Campus. Therefore, students
will normally enrol in 4.5 university credits in each of
years 1 and 2.

•	 In year 4 of the program, students are required to
enrol in JOUR 4010Y/4015C/4020D to complete the
capstone project, which is counted toward the Trent
joint-major discipline requirements.
•	 Joint-major Honours BA programs can normally be
completed within four years, except for the jointmajor Honours BA in Psychology, which can normally
be completed within five years. Joint-major Honours
BSc programs can normally be completed within five
years. Note that for completion of these degrees,
students may need to take courses during the
summer session.
•	 For students who began the program prior to 2015–
2016, the intensive six week summer Journalism
program at Loyalist College in Belleville follows years
1 and 2.
•	 Detailed information about the program and
progression through the degree is provided at
trentu.ca/journalism.

(Queen’s), PhD (Toronto)
Kinesiology is the scientific study of human movement
with a focus on prevention of injury and chronic disease.
Trent University collaborates with the University of
Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) to deliver this
comprehensive program in which the first two years are
completed at Trent’s Peterborough campus, and years
three and four at UOIT in Oshawa. Students gain the
knowledge and skills to become a kinesiology practitioner,
able to prescribe individualized exercise programs to
improve or maintain the health, functional capacity, and
well-being of a range of healthy and clinical populations.
	 Students in this major have the opportunity to apply
for applied internship opportunities in the fourth year of
study. Kinesiology is now a regulated health profession in
Ontario and this degree provides the skills and knowledge
to function as a health professional and write the
competency exam to become a registered kinesiologist.

The Bachelor of Science in Nursing program at Trent
University is a direct-entry professional degree program
with a limited number of student places. The program
leads to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree
(BScN). The program includes three streams of study—a
collaborative program, a compressed (second entry)
program, and a post-bridge PN to BScN pathway.
	 An integrated, collaborative four-year program, with
an option that allows completion in three-and-a-half
years, is offered with Fleming College for students
entering with appropriate secondary school credits or
equivalent. The compressed program is open to students
with sufficient university credits. The post-bridge PN to
BScN pathway is open to students who have successfully
completed the two bridging semesters at George
Brown College. Opportunities for practical application
of theoretical principles are offered throughout all three
programs. Using a holistic approach to care, students
learn to assess client needs and to plan, provide, and
evaluate care; students also learn to advocate for quality
health care. Various teaching methods are used in the
programs including lectures, labs, seminars, case studies,
simulations, and online learning.
	 At each level of the program there is a specific focus
for theory and practice. Clinical placements are selected
so that students are exposed to a variety of practice
environments as they learn the complexities of caring for
individuals, families, groups, and communities. Subject
to availability and agency requirements, students may
have the opportunity to seek specialized placements
and/or to develop a specific practice focus in Indigenous
communities, mental health, rural health, aging, or
women’s health and gender.
	 Trent does not offer a post-RN to BScN program.
Individuals holding current registration as an RN (or
equivalent) with the College of Nurses of Ontario,
any other Canadian nursing regulatory body, or
internationally, are not eligible for admission to the
compressed or collaborative BScN programs at the School
of Nursing. Individuals are not eligible for admission to the
compressed or collaborative programs if they already hold
a BScN (or equivalent) degree. In addition, the program
is not structured to support the admission of individuals
who have completed physician education in Canada or
internationally. RPNs seeking entry to the program must
be registrants in good standing and without practice
restrictions with the College of Nurses of Ontario.

at least 65% in the BScN program. If at the end of
any term a student’s cumulative average falls below
65%, they will be required to meet with the School
of Nursing’s academic advisor. Students who fail to
raise their cumulative average to at least 65% in the
subsequent term will be required to meet with both
the School of Nursing’s academic advisor and the
program coordinator and, in collaboration with them,
develop and follow a plan to improve their grades.
Students who at the end of a third term have failed to
raise their cumulative average to at least 65% will be
withdrawn from the BScN program but not from the
University.
•	 Students who fail 2.0 credits of courses will be
withdrawn from the BScN program but not from the
University.
•	 Students will be allowed to repeat one Nursing
theory course for which they have received a grade
lower than 60%. Failure to raise this grade to 60%
or higher will result in withdrawal from the BScN
program but not from the University. Students who
receive a second grade lower than 60% in a Nursing
theory course will not be allowed to repeat that
course and will be withdrawn from the BScN program
but not from the University.
•	 Students will be allowed to repeat one failed Nursing
practice course over the duration of the program.

The Philosophy Department at Trent aims to provide
students with critical skills in understanding, evaluating,
defending, and criticizing arguments. Some students
recognize the intrinsic merits and interests of Philosophy.
Our program ensures that these students are provided
with grounding in the history of the discipline as well as
opportunities to explore areas of particular philosophical
interest. Other students wish to develop the kinds of
critical reading, writing, thinking, and speaking skills that
are best taught in Philosophy courses. These students
recognize the value of these skills whatever discipline
they study at Trent and whatever futures they imagine for
themselves. The undergraduate program at Trent offers
programs that are designed to satisfy the needs of both
kinds of students.

Physics is the most fundamental of the natural sciences.
It includes the study of electricity and magnetism,
gravitation, electronics, the motion of projectiles
and rotating bodies, heat, light and sound, and the
interactions between the smallest particles that make up
matter: electrons, protons, neutrons, and quarks. Because
of their fundamental nature, the concepts of physics
underlie much of modern astronomy, chemistry, biology,
medicine, and engineering. In particular, the traditional
route to becoming an astronomer has been through an
undergraduate degree in physics. Discoveries in physics
and astronomy continue to broaden our understanding
of the universe, advance space travel, speed up global
electronic communications, lead to new products such as
ferroelectric computer memories, assist forensic science,
and improve medical diagnostic techniques.

Psychology is defined as the scientific study of behaviour
and the mind. As such, psychological research provides
insight into questions on topics such as newborn infants’
preference for their mother’s voice, the link between
personality and academic achievement or physical
health, how sleep influences learning and memory, the
identification of individuals who are at risk for Alzheimer’s
disease or cancer, sexual negotiation and behaviour in
young adults, or even how you understand these words
you are reading right now. Psychology is a scientific
discipline with a multitude of practical applications: it
deals with every aspect of our lives, and in its application
of scientific methods to questions of human concern, it
helps us to better understand how and why people act,
think, and feel the way they do. The Psychology program
at Trent ensures that students acquire research skills and
a broad-based background in the basic content of the
discipline, and that they have the opportunity at upper
levels to focus on more specialized topics and to become
involved in original research.
Notes
•	 60% or higher in PSYC 1020H and 1030H (or in
PSYC 1010Y) is a prerequisite for all upper-level
Psychology courses.
•	 A 4U Mathematics course is strongly recommended
for students who plan to major in Psychology.
•	 All courses in Psychology fulfill University science
course requirements for the BSc.
•	 Any course involving work with live vertebrate
animals requires the Animal Care Course, which is
described on p. 13 of the Calendar. The Animal
Care Course requirement is indicated in some course
descriptions but may also apply to others. Check with
the course instructor if in doubt.
•	 For non-majors taking courses where PSYC 2018H
or 2019H is a prerequisite, a statistics course in
another discipline may be substituted, but only if the
permission of the department has been granted.
• 	 A maximum 2.0 credits consisting of either reading
courses (PSYC 3900Y, 3901H, 3902H, 4900Y, 4901H,
and 4902H) and/or research practicum courses (PSYC
3801H, 3802H, 4801H, and 4802H) may be counted
toward the course requirements for a major or jointmajor degree in Psychology.
•	 Offerings of 4000-level courses change from year
to year. A listing of the 4000-level courses for
2017–2018 is published in the Psychology Student
Handbook, available in spring 2017 (department
office and website, trentu.ca/psychology).
•	 The Psychology Honours thesis is a major research
project counting as 2.0 credits in PSYC or combining
1.0 credit in PSYC and 1.0 in the other discipline in a
joint-major. Both options are open to joint-majors.

The challenging field of social work provides essential
supports to communities by helping its individuals,
groups, and families meet their basic human needs,
and by creating the conditions necessary for social
change. The Bachelor of Social Work at Trent University
prepares graduates with the knowledge and skills for
meaningful professional practice in a wide range of social
work contexts. Through an interdisciplinary curriculum
grounded in social justice, human rights, and cultural
awareness, students develop a strong foundation of
clinical knowledge, critical thinking skills, and social
responsibility. In the first two years of the program,
students explore a range of contemporary themes
connected to social work from across disciplines. Students
who qualify for the professional years—years three and
four of the program—focus exclusively on social work
theory and practice, including 700 hours of supervised
placement.
Notes

students. Any student can declare a major in Social
Work for the generalist years (years 1 and 2).
•	 Students must apply to enter year 3 of the program
(the first of two professional years). Admission is
competitive and spaces are limited.

Trent. For students with more than 10.0 university
credits, the best 8.0 credits that meet the generalist
requirements (6.0 credits in Humanities and/
or Social Sciences and/or Psychology, and 2.0
additional credits) plus the 2.0 required SWRK
credits, will be used in the calculation of the
average.

The Sustainable Agriculture & Food Systems program
is offered by the Trent School of the Environment. The
program was created in response to interest in how we
grow and consume food. The promise of sustainable
agriculture; the environmental, social, and ethical
consequences of conventional agriculture; investment
in industrial crops to supply fuel and materials; ongoing
risks to food security and human health; demand for
local food production in the context of global food trade;
cultural and social critiques of our food system, such as
the Slow Food movement and advocacy of animal rights;
growing interest in urban agriculture and in First Nations
agriculture—these and other developments testify to how
agriculture and food have become topics of discussion
across Ontario and Canada. Graduates of the program
will be equipped to contribute to these discussions, and
to pursue diverse employment opportunities in agriculture
and food.
Notes
•	 Both the BA and BSc programs are designed to
provide an opportunity for interdisciplinary study
of agriculture and food. Accordingly, students
pursuing either degree will take courses from
several departments, as described in the program
requirements below.
•	 Courses in Sustainable Agriculture & Food Systems

Freshwater systems provide many essential ecosystem
services, such as clean water, food, energy, recreation,
climate regulation, and waste assimilation. As human
populations and economies grow, demand for these
ecosystem services will continue to increase. The Water
Sciences program provides students with the knowledge
and skills they will need to respond to contemporary
water challenges, in Canada and internationally. A
cooperative undertaking of the School of the Environment
and the Departments of Biology and Chemistry, the
program draws from courses which together provide
students with the technical and theoretical foundation
for study of the science of water and the aquatic
environment.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS & OPPORTUNITIES

249

In addition to the major, joint-major, and minor degree
programs described in the Academic Programs section
of the Calendar, students can take advantage of a range
of special programs and opportunities. These include
completing courses online, possibilities for international
study experience, and involvement in research projects in
the local community. Emphases and Options, consisting
of groups of courses with a particular focus, are available
as a complement to regular programs. Specializations
provide additional focus within individual programs.

Special Programs and Opportunities

The Individualized Studies program (p. 179) is available
to students whose academic interests cannot be met by
majors in any of the existing programs.
	 Trent also provides opportunities to combine community
college and university study. A number of degree
completion programs have been developed through
articulation agreements with several community colleges
and Trent also offers some programs in partnership with
Fleming College in Peterborough and Lindsay.

Trent/Swansea Dual Degree
Trent University, in partnership with Swansea University,
United Kingdom, offers a dual degree leading to a
Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree (BA) and a Single
Honours Law degree (LLB). The program allows students
to complete the requirements for both degrees in a
structured six-year program of study.
Upon admission to Trent University, students select
a major in one of the available subjects for the dual
degree: Canadian Studies, Economics, English Literature,
Environmental & Resource Studies, Gender & Women’s
Studies, History, International Development Studies,
Philosophy, Political Studies, or Sociology. Students
spend their first two years of full-time study at Trent in
Peterborough or Durham, taking 10.0 credits toward
their Bachelor of Arts (Honours) program (5.0 credits
per academic year). Students then transfer to Swansea
University for years three, four, and five to complete their
study in the LLB degree program, taking on a full-time
course load (120 credits per academic year). Following
successful completion of the LLB with the required
minimum overall average, students are awarded transfer
credits and return to Trent to complete the requirements
for the BA program, which include courses focused in
Canadian Law to prepare for the National Committee on
Accreditation exams.
Students will graduate at the end of the sixth year with
both an undergraduate Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree
from Trent University and a Single Honours Law degree
from Swansea University.
As this is a dual degree and not a joint degree, Swansea
University reserves all rights to make adjustments to the
required courses for the LLB degree at any point in time.
The most up-to-date program overview can be found at
swansea.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/law/
llbsinglehonourslaw

Academic Progression
Application to the Trent/Swansea dual degree is through
the Ontario University Application Centre (ouac.on.ca).
Students must achieve a minimum secondary school
average of 80% to be admitted to the program. This
entry grade is subject to change annually based on the
application cohort and the number of spaces available
in the program; however, the minimum average for
acceptance to the program will never fall below 80%.
To progress successfully to year three of the dual degree
at Swansea University, students must complete an Intent
to Continue onto Studies form in order to transfer to
Swansea for the LLB portion of the dual degree and must
have:
•	successfully completed years one and two at Trent
University with a minimum cumulative average of
77%;
•	successfully completed no fewer than 10.0 Trent
University credits before enrolling in classes at
Swansea (a maximum of 5.0 transfer credits is
allowable toward this total);
•	declared the program major for the Trent BA degree;
•	obtained and provided proof of an approved Tier 4
(General) Study Visa;
•	confirmation that they have not been found to have
breached any disciplinary regulations; and
•	no known reasons to be denied access to the United
Kingdom.
Following successful completion of the LLB degree at
Swansea University, student transcripts will be forwarded
to the Office of the Registrar at Trent University to ensure
standards are met for awarding of transfer credits. At
this point in time students will be reactivated as current
students at Trent University and enter into the final year of
study to obtain all requirements for successful completion
of the Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree.
Students currently studying at Trent and transfer students
from other post-secondary institutions who have been
admitted to Trent University may be able to access the
Trent/Swansea dual degree. Contact the Office of the
Registrar for further details.

G. Burns, BA (York), MA (Guelph)
Graduating students who have fulfilled the requirements
for a General or Honours degree in any subject may
apply for an Emphasis in Global Studies, if they have also
successfully completed a year of Study Abroad and 6.0
credits in international/global studies from a list approved
by the Global Studies Advisory Committee (available

approved credits, at least 2.0 must be from IDST 1001H
and 1002H (or 1000Y), HIST 1400Y (or 1700Y), POST
2200Y, or POST 2230Y.

The Emphasis in Global Power & Politics (GP) is offered
by the Global Politics Section within the Department of
Political Studies. It is intended for students interested in
developing a critical understanding of the formal and
informal, visible and hidden structures of power in the
global age. A critical approach starts from the premise
that the most urgent political problems of our time
pose fundamental moral problems that require not only
goodwill and commitment, but a deep understanding
of the mechanisms of global power and politics. From
imperialism and resource wars to the corruption of both
liberal democracy and socialism, as well as the ubiquitous
rise of inequality, those who desire to make a difference
must seek this expanded knowledge. While housed in
the social sciences, the Emphasis also seeks to appeal
to politically-minded students in the sciences and the
humanities.
	 The Emphasis option in Global Power & Politics is
closely tied to the work done in the Centre for the Critical
Study of Global Power & Politics (see Research Centres).
Students are invited to participate in the work of the
Centre. Students are strongly encouraged to explore the
thesis option in their final year of study.

credited towards a Trent Honours degree but do not fulfill
specific departmental requirements. The Trent University
academic transcripts of students completing the program
with an average of at least 65% in courses taken at
Trent and 70% in courses taken at Fleming will contain
the notation “with an Emphasis in Museum Studies.”
Graduates will also receive an Ontario College Graduate
Certificate in Museum Management and Curatorship
from Fleming College.
	 Note: The Emphasis in Museum Studies is being
discontinued. Currently enrolled students will be able to
apply for admission to the program as outlined below.

who began studies at Trent after the commencement of
the 2017 Fall/Winter session.
	 Trent students will continue to be eligible to apply to
the Museum Management and Curatorship Graduate
Certificate program in their fourth year of study, to pursue
the program immediately following their Trent degree.
Students pursuing the program following graduation from
Trent are not eligible for the Emphasis in Museum Studies,

The Emphasis in Premodern Studies answers a growing
student interest in the thought, literature, and history
of the pre-industrial (pre-1800) world. While the more
remote past is often romanticized as a “golden fantasy
realm,” the study of historical culture in world civilizations
from antiquity through early modernity (ca. 1800) allows
students a window onto the origins and development of
culture informing modern global society.

Program Coordinator
A. Ash, BA, BEd, (Queen’s), MA (Norwich)
The Emphasis in Teacher Education is intended for
students who are planning a single- or joint-major
Honours program, who wish to prepare themselves to
teach at the elementary or secondary level, and who
are considering applying to a Consecutive Bachelor of
Education program upon the completion of their Honours
degree. Students must have a minimum cumulative
average of 70% at the end of their final year to graduate
with the Emphasis designation. The transcripts of students
graduating with an Honours degree who have successfully
completed the requirements of the Emphasis will contain
the notation “with an Emphasis in Teacher Education.”
Although the requirements for the Emphasis in Teacher
Education can be met within the 20.0 credits required
for the completion of an Honours degree, students
may choose or need to take extra courses to fulfill the
requirements.
	 The Emphasis does not guarantee admission to any
Consecutive BEd program. Since the course requirements
for admission to Consecutive BEd programs differ for
elementary and secondary candidates, the requirements
for the Emphasis in Teacher Education also differ based on
which stream students choose.
Entry into the Emphasis in Teacher Education
In order to meet the program requirements, full- or parttime students should enter the Emphasis in their first
year. Qualified students who have completed a maximum
of 5.0 credits with at least a 70% average may also be
eligible to enter the Emphasis program.
	 Students will need to plan their programs carefully
in order to ensure that they take necessary prerequisite
courses for any of the designated courses. The designated
courses are suitable for admission into Consecutive BEd
programs across Canada but students are strongly advised
to confirm the specific admission requirements for the
program to which they will be applying.
PRIMARY/JUNIOR STREAM
In addition to completing the requirements for an
Honours degree, there are 5.5 required credits for the
Primary/Junior stream. These credits are to be selected
from the designated lists of courses below and must
include:
–	2.0 credits in Curriculum Studies (including at least
1.0 credit in mathematics and/or science and 1.0
credit in visual or performing arts)
–	2.0 credits in Foundational Studies
–	0.5 credit in Indigenous Studies
–	EDUC 4000Y or 1.0 additional credit in Curriculum or
Foundational Studies

Indigenous Studies credit, a Curriculum Studies credit,
and an I/S teachable in Native Studies; an ENGL course
that is on the Foundational Studies list can simultaneously
be used to meet the requirement for an I/S teachable in
English and for a Foundational Studies credit.
1) 	 Curriculum Studies (at least 2.0 credits)
–	At least 1.0 credit in mathematics or science selected
from any Mathematics credit (or the completion
of both PSYC 2016H and 2017H or PSYC 2018H
and 2019H) or any credit in Biology, Chemistry,
Environmental & Resource Science, Physical
Geography, or Physics (these include ERSC-BIOL

INTERMEDIATE/SENIOR STREAM
In addition to the requirements for a single- or joint-major
Honours BA or BSc, there are 11.5 required credits for
the Intermediate/Senior stream. These credits are to be
selected from the designated list of subjects and courses
below and must include:
–	5.0 credits in the first teaching subject
–	3.0 credits in the second teaching subject (4.0 credits
for French as a second teachable)
–	2.0 credits in Foundational Studies
–	0.5 credit in Indigenous Studies
–	EDUC 4000Y or 1.0 additional credit in Foundational
Studies
Where applicable, the same course may simultaneously
meet the requirements of more than one element of
the Emphasis in Teacher Education. For example, an
INDG course that is on the Curriculum Studies list can
simultaneously be used to meet the requirements for an
Indigenous Studies credit, a Curriculum Studies credit,
and an I/S teachable in Native Studies; an ENGL course
that is on the Foundational Studies list can simultaneously
be used to meet the requirement for an I/S teachable in
English and for a Foundational Studies credit.
1) 	Curriculum Studies (5.0 credits in first teaching
subject, 3.0 credits in second teaching subject. Note
that French as a second teaching subject requires 4.0
credits.)
		 There are various teaching subjects to choose from
and students should confirm which ones are offered
in the consecutive programs they intend to apply
to. In Trent’s BEd program, teaching subjects include
Biology, Chemistry, Computer Studies, Dramatic
Arts, English, French, Geography, History, Native
Studies, Mathematics, Physics, Visual Arts, and
Health and Physical Education. The minimum 5.0 +
3.0 requirement can be met through a single-major
Honours degree, with three additional credits in a
second teaching subject, or through a joint-major
Honours degree in two teaching subjects.

Trent Online
Trent University’s online courses offer a quality learning
experience, convenience, and flexibility. These courses
require the same commitment as traditional, on-campus
courses. Students can expect the same content and
workload; materials will be presented in a different way.
Online courses include multimedia materials and take
advantage of web-based communication technologies.
Regular Internet access is required, whether at home, a
friend’s house, a local library, or a Trent computer lab.
	 Online courses are available to both students enrolled at
Trent and at other Canadian universities. Visiting students
may take an online course through Trent by first obtaining
a letter of permission (LOP) from their home university.
Students can be full-time or part-time, depending on how
many courses they take in a given term.
	 Blackboard, Trent’s online course management system,
allows students to:
• interact with a variety of rich learning materials
including visuals, audio, multimedia, and links to
Internet resources;
	 • interact with instructors and classmates; and
• navigate course content at their own pace, from
anywhere, while completing scheduled activities and
assignments by established dates.
Course Expectations
Students can expect the same learning requirements
in an online course as in an on-campus course. Many
online courses started out as on-campus courses and
have been optimized for the online learning environment.
This means that the readings and assignments may be
identical to what is being done in the on-campus class.
Anyone considering taking an online course should be
sure to have the necessary time and skills to complete all
components of the course.
Recommended Skills
•	 Reading—much of the course content in an online
course is delivered as reading material.
•	 Self-direction and time management—because
students will not be in the same room as the
instructor, they must be independent enough to
know when ask for help, and be able to organize
their schedule appropriately to get the work done on
time.
•	 Computer literacy—while online students do not
need to be computer professionals, communication
with instructors and other students requires email
skills, word processing skills, and the ability to
navigate the Blackboard Learning System. Courses
may require additional computer literacy specific to
the area of study.

Exams
Most online courses have an in-person, final exam,
although some will use a web-based exam or a takehome paper. The Trent Online Office will work with all
students required to write in-person to ensure that they
have access to the exam. If the student lives further than
200 km from Peterborough or Durham, he/she will NOT
be required to travel to a Trent campus to write the exam;
instead, arrangements will be made to allow them to
write a proctored/invigilated exam at a local testing centre
or with an approved local proctor. Online Proctoring is
also available which allows remote proctors to supervise
an exam through a webcam at any quiet location with a
reliable Internet connection. The decision regarding the
type and format of the final exam rests solely with the
instructor and his/her department.
Registration & Fees
Trent University does not distinguish between an online
student and an on-campus student. Registering for an
online course works the same way as registering for
most other courses. Online courses are identified with a
WEB marker in the myTrent registration system. Students
will have access on Blackboard to courses in which they
have registered beginning five days before the course
commences. Please visit the Trent website, and the
Registration Procedures and Visiting Students sections of
this Calendar (p. 290, p. 286), for more information on
registration and letters of permission.
	 The cost of taking an online course is the same as
taking an on-campus course. Textbooks, which can be
purchased from the Trent University Campus Store, may
be required for online courses as with any other course.
On the Campus Store website, find the correct online
course by choosing “Peterborough” when selecting your
program and “W” for the section.

students in all disciplines can participate in an exchange
with universities in many countries.
	 The exchange normally takes place in the third year of a
General or an Honours program. Students may participate
in a Study Abroad exchange or coordinate, with the
assistance of Trent International Study Abroad Program
(TI), their own Study Abroad program. Students receive
full credit for all approved courses completed successfully
in exchange and Year Abroad programs, including courses
in community development that involve work placements.
Specific departmental Study Abroad programs are also
offered at Trent. These programs combine academic
courses with work-placement experience.

placements at agencies in Africa under the supervision of
the World University Service of Canada (WUSC).
Study Abroad Awards, Bursaries, and Prizes
International study bursaries are designed to encourage
and support the broadening of the academic experience
through Study Abroad. These funds assist Trent students
planning to study abroad and international scholars
attending Trent for a year of study. Funds are awarded
for academic merit, based on financial need, or as a
departmental prize. Applications are available on myTrent.

Internationally Oriented Groups

Trent Community Research Centre (Peterborough)
(formerly Trent Centre for Community-Based Education)
trentcentre.ca
U-Links Centre for Community-Based Research
(Haliburton)
ulinks.ca
The Community-Based Research (CBR) and Community
Service-Learning (CSL) programs are innovative
approaches to experiential learning and research.
They offer undergraduate and graduate students the
opportunity to gain academic credit and on-the-job
experience by undertaking supervised research projects
with local government, non-profit organizations, charities,
and conservation agencies in Peterborough City and
County and Haliburton County.
	 The CBR and CSL programs are designed to:
•	 work with community organizations on communitybased research and other identified projects that
otherwise might not be completed;
•	 provide students with real-world research experience
in their fields of study and a wide-range of
transferrable skills that enhance future employment
prospects; and
•	 increase co-operation and partnership between
Trent University and the broader communities it
serves.
What is Community-Based Research?
Community-based research brings together the
knowledge and research needs of the community with
the research expertise of Trent University faculty and
students. Research questions come from a wide range
of community groups and organizations including local
municipalities, social service agencies, conservation
authorities, and community interest groups. Organizations
submit project proposals to the Trent Community
Research Centre (TCRC, Peterborough) or U-Links
(Haliburton). Once projects have been reviewed by
research staff, faculty, and community experts, these
project opportunities are promoted to students and
instructors. Centre staff work alongside faculty to support
students in their work and help guide projects towards
successful outcomes for both the local community and
students.
	 The work involved and time commitment needed for
project completion can vary greatly. Community-Based
Research (CBR) projects can be carried out as full- or halfcredit undergraduate courses, undergraduate or Master’s
thesis, major research paper, PhD dissertation, or as an
assignment within a course. Projects can commence at
the beginning of Fall, Winter, or Summer terms. The TCRC
and U-Links also provide paid internship or fellowship
opportunities on specific projects. Staff members at TCRC
and U-Links provide support to students in the selection
of projects that match their interests and program
requirements, and ongoing support throughout their
research.

How does it work? — Course Based
Undergraduate students can sign-up for one of three
4000-level undergraduate courses where every student
in that course completes a CBR project, either individually
or in teams. The structure of these courses, including
any lectures or seminars, is focused towards communitybased research. Courses are currently available in Forensic
Science (FRSC 4890Y), Geography (GEOG 4030Y),
and International Development Studies (IDST 4220Y).
Undertaking a CBR project is also an optional assignment
in a number of departments and courses including
Environmental & Resource Science/Studies (ERSC 3160H)
and History (HIST 3011H). Future courses may be available
in other departments.
How does it work? — Independent Study
Undergraduate students can also complete a communitybased research project as a form of independent study,
as either a half, full, or double credit. In following this
independent model, students identify a project on the
TCRC website (trentcentre.ca/students) they would
like to work on and then, in conjunction with the
TCRC or U-Links, find an instructor to supervise their
work. Students then meet with the community host
organization to ensure a compatible match. Program staff
assist with these steps, but participation in a project is
contingent on the instructor’s permission and, in some
cases, that of the academic department. Ideally, project
arrangements should be initiated before the start of the
semester; however, students have until the University
Add Course deadlines (see Important Dates, p. 6) to
complete registration.
	 To apply to do an independent CBR project, students
should first review available projects on the TCRC
website (trentcentre.ca) and complete the application
form, including the submission of resume and
cover letter. The application form can be found at:
trentcentre.ca/students/student-application-form. Course
codes for a CBR project exist in most departments (see list
of course codes below).
	 Prerequisite: The CBR program is open to senior
undergraduate students who have completed a minimum
of 10.0 university credits. Students must have a minimum
75% cumulative average. Students may be subject to
further prerequisites by individual academic departments
and instructors. Students who do not meet the above
requirements but wish to participate should contact the
TCRC to discuss potential exemptions. Community host
organizations may screen students for relevant skills and
knowledge.

Special Programs and Opportunities

Community-Based Research & Community Service-Learning Programs

Community Service-Learning Projects
Community Service-Learning projects are usually 10 to
20 hours in length (per student) and are undertaken as
assignments within courses. Program staff will work with
instructors and host organizations to clarify project details
and TCRC/U-Links registration.
Prerequisite: Community Service-Learning projects are
only available to students within participating courses.
Students may be subject to further prerequisites by
individual departments and instructors. Community host
organizations may screen students for relevant skills and
knowledge.
Roles and Resources
The Community-Based Research and Community
Service-Learning programs fulfill a community-defined
need for a common point of contact with the University
and provide an extensive community development
network for students and faculty wanting to work
with local government, and non-profit organizations.
Host organizations involved in the programs provide
supervision, facilities, services, and materials. Participating
faculty provide academic supervision, grade students’
work, and support students in a manner consistent with
other University courses. Students receive innovative
research, leadership, and career-building experience while
applying theory to practice in local community settings.
The TCRC and U-Links develop new research projects and
support those underway, provide resources and contacts,
and facilitate communication among all participants.
	 The TCRC and U-Links each maintain online and
physical resource libraries that include materials about
local community groups and initiatives; completed local
research projects; and the practice of community-based
research, community service learning, and experiential
education. Students or faculty who wish to arrange
research and educational projects and partnerships with
local community organizations are strongly encouraged to
contact the TCRC.

Course Codes
Most departments have course codes for independent
CBR projects at 3rd and 4th year levels, and as half- and
full-credits. If a department does not have a specific
course code for CBR, please contact the TCRC for more
information. CBR work can also be undertaken as a
double or single credit thesis where this option is offered
by a department.

The mission of the Canadian Environmental Modelling
Centre (CEMC) is to contribute to the improved
management of chemicals in our environment by
acquiring and analyzing appropriate data and developing,
validating, and disseminating mass balance models that
describe the fate of chemicals in the environment. The
objective of the CEMC is to understand and predict
quantitatively the pathways of contaminant transport
and the resulting exposure. When we can establish a
quantitative link between sources, exposure, and risk of
effects, we are in a strong position to control sources
to acceptably low levels, avoiding the problems of
unacceptable contamination from excessive sources on
the one hand, and uneconomic, unnecessary regulations
on the other. Emphasis at the CEMC is placed on training
undergraduate and graduate students in environmental
science, on co-operation with the other faculty at Trent,
and on providing research services relevant to current
Canadian and international needs. The CEMC is a part
of the larger, multi-university Canadian Environmental
Modelling Network (CEMN) and collaborates actively with
other researchers both nationally and internationally.

Institute of Integrative Conservation
Biology
Contact: D. Murray, Biology
dennismurray.ca
In the coming decades, society must improve its ability
to understand, predict, and develop responses to
environmental change, if we are to avoid or mitigate
the expected profound human influences on natural
and managed landscapes and ecosystems. Conservation
biology, which traditionally involves the integration
of genetics, physiology, mathematics, ecology, and
computer modelling, is a core discipline that addresses
a broad range of questions and challenges associated
with contemporary and future environmental change. In
the twenty-first century, however, conservation biology
must also include increased emphasis on the human
dimensions of environmental change through further
integration of disciplines like sociology, anthropology,
economics, and psychology, lest we risk developing
strategies and policies that have neither public support
nor high probability of success. Established in 2015,
the IICB capitalizes on existing research strengths and
synergies in the area of conservation biology to stimulate
and enhance robust and relevant environmental change
research at Trent University. Specifically, the mission of the
IICB is to promote and facilitate interdisciplinary research,
collaboration, and graduate teaching and training in
conservation biology and related fields, to influence
research and policy decisions at the regional, national and
international scales.

Advanced Placement (AP) Program
All applicants who have completed Advanced Placement courses from the College Board are required to submit their
examination results for evaluation. Advanced standing or transfer credit will be granted for most Advanced Placement
courses with examination grades of four (4) or better, to a maximum of 5.0 credits (one full year of study).

Canadian Universities
Students applying from another accredited university
will be considered for admission following at least one
semester of study with a minimum 65% average (2.0
GPA on a scale of 4.0). Admission consideration is based
on a student’s overall academic background including
secondary school results. Applicants are advised they will
normally require a higher academic average than the
published minimum. Up to 10.0 credits (the equivalent of
two years of full-time study) may be transferred toward
an undergraduate degree program for courses completed
with a minimum of 60% (see Transfer Credits, p. 287).
	 Students holding a first degree may be admitted to
undertake a second undergraduate degree. Those with
first degrees from universities may be admitted with a
minimum average of 65% (2.0 GPA on a scale of 4.0)
and may receive up to 10.0 credits toward a second
undergraduate degree. Please refer to the Second Degree
section on p. 300 for further information about second
degrees. Anyone may also apply for individual courses
for general interest, or to upgrade to an Honours degree
for application to graduate school. Students serving a
term of academic suspension or academic debarment at
an accredited Canadian university will normally not be
eligible for entrance consideration during the period of
suspension or debarment.
Canadian Community Colleges
Students applying from a community college situated in
Canada will be considered for admission following at least
one semester of study with a minimum 65% average (2.0
GPA on a scale of 4.0). Admission consideration is based
on a student’s overall academic background including
secondary school results. Enrolment is limited and the
University will select the most qualified candidates for
admission. Transfer credit to a maximum of 10.0 credits
may be granted based on overall academic background,
length of program, and on the recommendations of the
appropriate departments at Trent University.
Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology
(CAAT)
Students applying from a College of Applied Arts and
Technology (CAAT) will be considered for admission
upon completion of at least one semester of full-time
study in an acceptable diploma program with an overall
average of 65% (2.0 GPA on a scale of 4.0) or better.
Enrolment is limited and the University will select the most
qualified candidates for admission. Transfer credit to a
maximum of 10.0 credits may be granted based on overall
academic background, length of program, and on the
recommendations of the appropriate departments at Trent
University.

Enrolment is limited and the University will select the most
qualified candidates for admission. Students who have
successfully completed two years of full-time study at
CEGEP may be eligible for transfer credit to a maximum
of 5.0 credits (equivalent to one year of full-time study),
depending on the overall academic average or the
recommendations of the appropriate departments at Trent
University.
Foreign Post-secondary Institutions
Students applying from an accredited university degree,
college diploma, or associate degree program outside
Canada will be considered for admission following the
completion of at least one semester of study. Admission
consideration is based on the student’s overall academic
background including secondary school results. Academic
averages required will depend on the academic system.
Enrolment is limited and the University will select the
most qualified candidates for admission. Transfer credit to
a maximum of 10.0 credits (the equivalent of two years
of full-time study) may be granted depending on course
content and marks. Applicants holding a first degree
may be admitted to undergraduate studies to undertake
a second undergraduate degree. Applicants may not
undertake a second degree in the same major or minor as
their first degree. They may, however, apply to upgrade
from a three-year degree to a four-year Honours degree in
the same major as their first degree. Applicants may also
apply for individual courses for general interest.

Visiting (Non-degree) Students
Students wishing to enrol in courses at Trent University for
a particular academic session but who are not pursuing a
formal Trent University credential (i.e., degree, diploma, or
certificate) are defined as Visiting (Non-degree) students.
All Visiting students are required to follow the usual
admissions procedures and are expected to meet the
same admission requirements as degree students at Trent
University. Visiting students are not evaluated for transfer
credit.
	 Letter of Permission students are Visiting Students
who are intending their Trent coursework to be applied
to a credential at another accredited post-secondary
institution. In addition to meeting the requirements
above, students applying to Trent University on Letter
of Permission must also submit an official Letter of
Permission from their home institutions. An offer of
admission does not guarantee registration in the courses
indicated on the Letter of Permission. Students may be
required to obtain permission from appropriate academic
departments.
	 Special Students are Visiting Students who are not
intending their Trent coursework to be applied to a
credential at any other accredited post-secondary
institution.

Quebec Applicants from CEGEP
Students applying from CEGEP are required to present at
least 12 academic courses. A minimum overall average
of 65% is required. The admission average is based on
all academic courses completed for credit. Failed courses
will be taken into consideration in determining admission.

Readmission

Transfer Credits

287

Readmission refers to the process by which former Trent
University students apply to return to their studies.
For a full overview of readmission procedures visit
trentu.ca/readmit.
I.	Students in any of the following situations must
complete an application in order to be considered for
readmission to Trent University (further information on
the application process can be found at:
trentu.ca/futurestudents/undergraduate/
requirements/former-trent-student
	1.	students who have attended another post-secondary
institution after leaving Trent University voluntarily; or
	2.	students who have been required to leave the
University for academic reasons.
		 (Studies completed at another post-secondary
institution during a term of suspension may be
considered as a basis for readmission to the University
but may not necessarily be considered for transfer
credit.)
II.	Students in any of the following situations, who left
Trent University voluntarily, and who have not attended
another post-secondary institution, can return to studies
by contacting Enrolment Services in the Office of the
Registrar:
	1.	students in good standing;
	2.	students on probation;
	3.	students who have graduated; or
	4.	students who have completed an undergraduate
degree at Trent University and who have gone on to
complete graduate-level studies.
III. Students who left Trent due to an academic dishonesty
suspension must contact Enrolment Services in the
Office of the Registrar for next steps on returning to
Trent.

Transfer credit refers to the course equivalencies granted
towards a program of study based on acceptable
academic degree-level or diploma-level coursework from
an accredited post-secondary institution. Advanced
standing and transfer credit may also be granted for some
standardized advanced secondary school programs (see
Admissions from Secondary School Systems on p. 282
for details).
	 Trent University subscribes to the Council of Ontario
Universities’ policy on the transfer of course credit and
supports the intent of the Pan-Canadian Protocol on the
Transferability of University Credits.

Policies & Administration

Involuntary Withdrawal
If students are required by the University to sit out for an
academic year (or more) for non-academic reasons, they
are considered to have withdrawn involuntarily from the
University (see the full policy in the Policy Library on the
Trent website). The University reserves the right to apply
additional criteria for readmission after an involuntary
withdrawal which include but are not limited to: a
reduced course load, regular contact with an academic
advisor, ongoing counselling, or behavioural contracts
(depending upon the specific nature of the involuntary
withdrawal). Readmission procedures are stipulated in the
letter from the University that such students receive at
the time the involuntary withdrawal is imposed. Students
suspended for non-academic reasons who wish to return
to their studies are encouraged to contact their academic
advisor.

Trent University Transfer Credit Policy
1.	Courses from accredited universities are considered
for transfer credit when successfully completed with
a grade of 60% or higher. Courses from accredited
colleges and institutions of technology may be
considered for transfer credit when completed with a
grade of 70% or higher.
2.	A grade of “P” (pass) is assigned to all transfer
credits; therefore, transfer credits will not be used
in determining the student’s cumulative Grade Point
Average at Trent University (see Academic Status on
p. 295).
3.	Transfer credit is designated in three different ways:
		 I.		Assigned credit is used when there is a Trent
University equivalent.
	II.		Unassigned credit in a subject area is used for
courses without Trent University equivalents, but
which are acceptable to a department as fulfilling
subject requirements toward a degree in that
department. Individual departments may restrict
the number of unassigned credits that may be
counted toward a degree in that department.
	III.	General elective credit is used for courses which
are judged to be transferable but do not fulfill
specific departmental requirements. General
elective credits are expressed in terms of arts
elective or science elective courses.
4.	The total number of non-Trent credits (either transfer
credits or credits taken on Letter of Permission) may
not exceed 10.0 for an Honours degree and 7.5
for a General degree. Specific degree requirements
may mean that not all transfer credits awarded are
applicable to a degree program.
5.	If a student transfers to a different degree program,
the transfer credits assigned on admission may not all
apply to the new degree program. It is the student’s
responsibility to discuss his or her academic program
requirements with an academic advisor and to notify
the Office of the Registrar of any program changes.
6.	Transfer credits are determined in accordance with
the policies and regulations effective at the time the
admission decision is made. Subsequent changes to
policies and regulations will not affect a previously
determined transfer credit assessment. Normally, once
transfer credits have been awarded and applied to
a student’s Trent academic record, they cannot be
removed from that record. Requests for reassessment

TRENT UNIVERSITY  2017–2018 Undergraduate Calendar | August 2017

TRANSFER CREDIT ELIGIBILITY BY JURISDICTION
Canadian Universities
All university-level credit courses that have been
completed at an accredited Canadian university, that are
academic in content and in which a minimum grade of
60% has been achieved, will be recognized for credit at
Trent University.
Canadian Community Colleges and Colleges of
Applied Arts & Technology in Ontario
Admissible applicants who have completed at least one
semester in a Canadian community college or an Ontario
College of Applied Arts and Technology will be eligible for
transfer credit consideration as follows:
i)	 Trent University has more than 60 Articulation
Agreements and MOUs which outline specific
required grades, transfer credits to be awarded,
and degree completion requirements. The terms of
an Articulation Agreement may supersede general
transfer credit policy (see Degree Completion
Programs, p. 270).
ii)	 Outside of an Articulation Agreement, individual
courses and programs which are academic in nature
will be considered for transfer credit. A minimum
grade of 70% is required in any community college
course to be considered for course-by-course transfer
credit assessment.
iii) As a general guide, graduates of a two-year highly
academic college program can expect to receive up to
5.0 transfer credits. Graduates of a three-year highly
academic program can expect to receive up to 7.5
credits.

CEGEP
Students who have successfully completed two years
of full-time study at CEGEP may be eligible for transfer
credit to a maximum of 5.0 credits (equivalent to one year
of full-time study), depending on the overall academic
average and the recommendations of the appropriate
departments at Trent University.
International Baccalaureate (IB)
Advanced standing and transfer credit will be granted
for higher level subjects passed with a grade of five (5) or
higher. The maximum credit that will be awarded from an
IB Diploma is 5.0 credits (one year of full-time study).

Advanced Placement (AP) Program
All applicants who have completed Advanced Placement
courses from the College Board are required to submit
their examination results for evaluation. Advanced
standing or transfer credit will be granted for most
Advanced Placement courses with examination grades of
four (4) or better, to a maximum of 5.0 credits (one full
year of study).
Private or Career Colleges
Although many private/career colleges are registered with
the Ministry of Education, most offer specific applied
(non-academic) career training. Trent University does not
grant transfer credit for programs completed at private/
career colleges.
Universities and Colleges outside of Canada
For students admitted to Trent University from an
accredited university degree, college diploma, or associate
degree program outside of Canada, a maximum of 10.0
transfer credits (the equivalent of two years of full-time
study) may be granted depending on course content and
grades. Students transferring to Trent from institutions
outside of Canada are encouraged to submit detailed
course descriptions or a course calendar of the institution
at which they studied.

Religious Institutions
Students who have completed a three- or four-year
program at an institution accredited by the Association for
Biblical Higher Education (ABHE) may be granted transfer
credit for academic courses in which a minimum grade of
70% has been attained.

Office in writing before the end of the first academic
year of study in which the student is admitted.
7.	Assignment of transfer credits for courses completed
more than 10 years ago will be considered on an
individual basis.
8.	In cases where the grading scheme for a university
or community college differs from Trent University’s
grading scheme, and a relevant grade translation is
not provided with the official transcript, grades will be
translated into the equivalent Trent University grades.
Eligibility for admission and transfer credit will be
assessed on the translated grades.
9.	Trent University does not grant Prior Learning
Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) credits. Credits
granted by another institution on the basis of PLAR
are not transferable to Trent University.
10. Trent University reserves the right to assign or not to
assign transfer credit.

should be aware that there are non-academic
requirements that must be completed before
registration. For details see p. 200.

Academic Information & Regulations

Fall/Winter Session—Continuing Students (Full-Time
and Part-Time)
Students normally register for Fall/Winter courses in June.
Students may register on myTrent, with their entrance to
the system governed by the number of credits completed
by the end of the previous Fall/Winter session. Students
who know that they will be unable to access myTrent
from a remote location may fill out a course preference
form available through the Office of the Registrar; this
form must be returned to the Office of the Registrar
before the end of May. On the form, students will list the
courses in which they wish to register. The student will
be registered by a staff member when the student would
have normally had access to myTrent.
	 Fall/Winter courses are offered in both Peterborough
and Durham, and online; locations of the courses are
listed in the academic timetable on myTrent.
Summer Session—Continuing Students (Full-Time
and Part-Time)
Students normally register for Summer session courses in
February through myTrent. Summer session courses are
offered in both Peterborough and Durham, and online.
Details are available at trentu.ca/summer.
New Part-Time Students
Students new to university study, as well as transfer and
readmit students, will be provided with instructions on
how to register using the web-based registration system.
Students are required to finalize their course selection and
submit any changes by the published due date.
Official Registration
Official registration is complete when the student has
registered in courses and forwarded the appropriate fee
payment (or evidence of external financial support) to
Student Accounts. Failure to complete this requirement by
the University’s published fee payment deadline will result
in cancellation of all registration in courses and college
residence assignments.
	 Students who have had their registration cancelled
and wish to continue their studies must contact the
Office of the Registrar for details on how to proceed with
registration. Payment of fees or deposits related to tuition
or residence does not excuse a student from compliance
with deadlines or other procedures related to registration.
Attending courses does not constitute official registration;
students are required to register in courses using myTrent
and to submit the appropriate tuition fees by the required
due date. Students who have not registered by the due
date will not receive a mark for the work completed and
will not receive credit for the course.

Changing From Part-Time to Full-Time
Studies
Students admitted on a part-time basis who wish to
transfer to full-time status for the next Fall/Winter session
must submit a request via myTrent by the required date.
The Office of the Registrar considers all applications
following review of final marks in May. Notifications
are e-mailed to students in mid-June. The minimum
requirements to transfer to full-time studies are: a current
academic status of Good Standing, 3.0 or more Trent
credits completed with a grade of 50% or higher, and a
cumulative average of 60% or higher. Possession of the
minimum requirements does not guarantee admission to
full-time studies.

Changes, Withdrawals, Refunds	
Once a student has registered in a course, a final grade
will be assigned for that course unless the student
withdraws from the course before the published deadline
for withdrawal. The deadlines for dropping, adding, and
withdrawing from courses are listed in the Important
Dates (p. 6) section of this Calendar. Students may
be de-registered automatically from courses where the
prerequisite standing has not been achieved.
Changes to Registration
Students wishing to drop or add courses must do so
through myTrent before the drop and add deadlines.
Withdrawal from the University
Students wishing to withdraw from their studies at Trent
University must fill out a Withdrawal Form, available
online through myTrent. TI students must contact the TI
office prior to completing the withdrawal form online.
Students are encouraged to discuss their decision with
an administrative staff person (college head, academic
advisor, or TI advisor). Students with student loans or
scholarships are advised to consult the Financial Aid Office
regarding any financial implications prior to withdrawal.
Students will not be considered withdrawn, and any
refunding of fees will not occur, until the Withdrawal
Form has been submitted online. Students living in
residence will not be considered to be withdrawn from
the University until their residence keys have been
returned to the Housing Services Office. Note that
students may temporarily withdraw from their studies for
a period of up to 12 months without having to undergo
the readmission process. Students who have questions
about the procedures and regulatory implications of
withdrawal from the University may contact the Office of
the Registrar.
Refunds
Please refer to the Fees section of this Calendar (p. 309)
for information on the refund policy and schedule.

“Late withdrawal” is withdrawal from courses, or
from the University, after the applicable deadline as
listed in the Important Dates (p. 6) section of this
Calendar. Students must petition for late withdrawal
by completing the appropriate forms available at
trentu.ca/academicpetitions. Petitions are considered by
the Committee on Undergraduate Petitions (CUP).

Notes:
•	 The maximums do not apply where a program’s
planned curriculum requires that students take an
additional load.
•	 Upon registration, students are responsible for
making themselves aware of the academic and
financial obligations and deadlines associated with
each course.

Access to Instruction
Academic Year and Sessions
The academic year begins on September 1 and is divided
into two “sessions”: the Fall/Winter session (normally
beginning in September and ending in April) and the
Summer session (normally beginning in May and ending
in August). The Fall/Winter session contains full-year
courses which are offered from September to April,
Fall-term courses which are offered from September to
December, and Winter-term courses which are offered
from January to April. The Fall and Winter terms last for
12 weeks each, and contain a one-week reading break
per term. The Summer session comprises one twelveweek term or two six-week terms.
	 The University offers field schools in Archaeology and
field courses in Biology, Geography, and Indigenous
Studies in the Summer session. Details of these courses
are available from the departments concerned.

Academic Load and Course Overload
For many academic purposes, a student registered in
3.5 credits or more is considered “full-time” and in 3.0
credits or fewer as “part-time.” It is not, however, the
same definition that may be used for other purposes and
students are advised to check with the administrative
office when determining their status.
Course overload for the Fall/Winter session is defined
as enrolment in more than 2.5 credits (or equivalent)
during the Fall term or the Winter term. Students
enrolling in credits in addition to the normal full-time load
are reminded that they are fully responsible for doing so
and are cautioned against possible academic difficulties.
Full-time students with an academic status of Good
Standing may overload 0.5 credits in each of the Fall or
Winter terms. Students with an academic status of Good
Standing who wish to overload in more than 0.5 credits
in the Fall or Winter terms must petition the Committee
on Undergraduate Petitions (CUP) for approval of course
overload. Students who do not have an academic status
of Good Standing must petition to the Committee on
Undergraduate Petitions for permission to overload.
Course overload for the Summer session: A full load
in a six-week summer term is 1.0 credit. Students with an
academic status of Good Standing may enrol in up to 1.5
credits in each six-week term. Students wishing to take
more than 1.5 credits in a six-week term must submit a
petition to the Committee on Undergraduate Petitions.

It is Trent University’s intent to create an inclusive
learning environment. If a student has a disability and
documentation from a regulated health care practitioner
and feels that he/she may need accommodations to
succeed in a course, the student should contact the
Student Accessibility Services Office (p. 326) at the
respective campus as soon as possible. Disabilities
include (but are not limited to) physical, sensory, medical,
psychological, and learning disabilities.
	 To allow students with disabilities to participate actively
and freely in courses, every reasonable effort will be made
to provide appropriate accommodations as outlined by
the Student Accessibility Services Office. A student’s desire
for anonymity is of utmost importance and confidentiality
will be respected.

myTrent
The Trent online portal, also known as myTrent, contains
important information and resources for students, faculty,
staff, and alumni. Various administrative services are
provided online and it is a hub for news about the Trent
community. MyTrent supplies access to myAcademic
Record, Trent email accounts, student financial accounts,
the Blackboard Learning System, and online forms (e.g.,
transcript requests, declaring majors, etc.). A student’s
official contact information may be updated at any time
through myTrent. Registration for courses takes place
online and all related information (timetables and exam
schedules) are housed on myTrent. The Student Accounts
Office maintains the student account balance and
payment history.

Change of Name
The Office of the Registrar is committed to the integrity
of its student records. Each student is therefore required
to provide his or her legal name on the application for
admission and in personal data required for registration.
Any requests to change a name, by means of alteration,
deletion, substitution, or addition, must be accompanied
by appropriate supporting documentation. Upon applying
to graduate, a student may be asked to provide legal
documentation as proof of his/her name.

Late Withdrawal from Courses and from the
University

Change of Address

Course Syllabuses

It is the student’s responsibility to maintain current
and up-to-date mailing address, email, and contact
information on the records of the University in order to
receive pertinent mailings, including Tuition and Education
Credit Certificates. Address changes and updates to
contact information may be done through myTrent.

Each course has a syllabus which includes the method of
assessment and the grading scheme.
	 In some cases an instructor may judge that certain
regulations are inappropriate for a particular course and
may be granted a formal exemption from them by the
appropriate dean (Humanities, Science, or Social Sciences).
Any such exemptions will be noted in the course syllabus.
	 The instructor reviews the syllabus with the students
at the first class in the course. Any change thereafter
in the grading scheme must be agreed to in writing by
all students present at a subsequent class; at the class
immediately following that one, the revised section of the
syllabus must be posted or otherwise communicated.

At the time of first registration at the University, students
are issued a Trent user ID and password and a Trent
email account. The Trent email account is considered the
official email account and will be the only email account
used to communicate with students for academic and
administrative purposes. Students are responsible for
ensuring that they monitor and maintain their Trent
email account and to ensure that email is accessed, read,
and acted upon in a timely fashion. Students should be
aware that emails from non-Trent accounts will not be
considered official.

Assignment Deadline Policy
Assignments (excluding take-home exams) in Fall/Winter
courses due after the last day of class and worth more
than 10% of the final grade in the course must be
provided to students no later than two weeks before the
last day of class.

Course Numbering and Course Credits

Student Contact Hours

Courses listed in this Calendar follow the form: SUBJ
1000. SUBJ refers to the department offering the course.
The first digit refers to the level of the course.

A full-credit classroom course normally consists of three
class contact hours each week for the Fall/Winter session
(September to April) or 72 hours (36 hours for halfcredit courses). Courses with a laboratory component
will normally exceed three class contact hours per week.
Summer session full- and half-credit courses represent the
equivalent number of class contact hours within a shorter
period of time.

Re-numberings
In 2010, the University completed the process of moving
to a four-digit numbering system for all courses offered
at the undergraduate level. Please consult course
descriptions for new numberings. In editions of the
Academic Calendar prior to 2016-17, the old threedigit course numbers appeared as exclusions. Wherever
a course was required as a pre- or co-requisite, the old
three-digit course numbers appeared in parentheses after
the new four digit course numbers.
Cross-Listed Courses
Many courses are cross-listed; that is, they are offered
jointly by two or more departments. Cross-listed courses
may not be double-counted in order to fulfill degree
requirements. For example, BIOL 1060H is cross-listed
with PHYS 1060H; it may be counted for credit as a
Biology course or as a Physics course but not as both.
Course Credit Value
Each course number is followed by a letter suffix which
denotes the credit value of that course.
Suffix
Q
H
Y
C
D

Credit Value
0.25 credit (or quarter-credit)
0.5 credit (or half-credit)
1.0 credit (or full-credit)

Definition of Year
A student’s progress towards a degree is measured
in terms of credits earned rather than years of study
completed. Where it is necessary or helpful to equate
credits earned with years of study, the following table may
be used:
Credits Completed
4.5 or fewer credits
5.0 to 9.5 credits
10.0 to 14.5 credits
15.0 credits or more

Mid-year Review
Mid-year marks for full-credit courses are available
through myAcademic Record in January to help students
assess their academic performance; they do not represent
official grades and do not appear on any formal
document.

Scheduling
With the exception of laboratory examinations in the
sciences, no in-class tests or final examinations which are
worth more than 10% of the final grade may be held
during the last two weeks of classes in the Fall or Winter
term. In the Summer session the period during which inclass tests and examinations may not be held is the last
two weeks for twelve-week courses and the last week for
six-week courses.
	 The examination schedule is designed to avoid conflicts
and to ensure that no student writes more than twice
within a calendar day. Note: a calendar day is defined
as 00:00-24:00 for exam purposes. Students who have
added courses after the examination schedule has
been produced may be expected to write more than
twice within a calendar day. In the case of take-home
examinations or tests, the instructor assigns a submission
date that must occur before the end of the examination
period.
	 The writing time allotted is the same for all students in
a course (with the exception of students registered with
Student Accessibility Services; see below).
	 Students who wish to observe cultural or religious
holidays during an examination period must notify the
Office of the Registrar in writing by the last day to add
courses each term (refer to Important Dates, p. 6). If
it is possible, scheduling will be adjusted to accommodate
these dates. If it is not possible, students must submit
a written request to their instructors for alternative
arrangements, explaining the reason for the request and
including supporting documentation.
	 Examinations and tests for students with disabilities
who require disability-related supports (e.g., extra time
or other assistance) are available. All requests must be
made through Student Accessibility Services (p. 326)
at least two weeks before the examination or test, and
must be supported by appropriate documentation from a
qualified health care diagnostician. Information regarding
documentation guidelines is available at trentu.ca/sas.
Student Identification
Students must bring their Trent student cards to all
examinations. Cards must be visible to the examination
invigilator. Students who fail to produce a valid student
card must report to the Office of the Dean of Arts &
Science with their card by 1:00 pm on the next working
day. Students whose names are not printed on an
attendance list are not registered in the course. They must
report to the Office of the Registrar by 1:00 pm on the
next working day to clarify their status. Failure to do so
will result in a grade of zero for the course.

Missed Examinations
Students who miss an examination for reasons beyond
their control should consult with their instructor
immediately. Alternate arrangements may be made at
the instructor’s discretion provided that the student has
supplied supporting documentation. If such arrangements
are not possible, students may request aegrotat standing
(see p. 295 for the requirements for aegrotat standing).
Unsatisfactory Examination Results
There are no supplemental examinations. The only options
available to students who are dissatisfied with the result
of an examination are to appeal the final grade in the
course (see Appeals of Final Grades, p. 296) or to repeat
the course (see Course Repeats, p. 294).
Student Access to Graded Examination Papers
Graded examination papers are the property of the
University and are not intended to be available to
students. They may be seen by students only if a
formal appeal of a final grade has been unsuccessful
(see Academic Appeals, p. 296). Requests to see an
examination paper must be made in writing to the Office
of the Registrar. There is a fee for each request.

Grades and Grading Schemes
Courses are graded on a percentage scale, except for
courses taken under a pass/fail option. Averages are
calculated using the percentage grade assigned to the
student for each course.
Numerical Equivalents of Letter Grades
A+ 90–100%
C+ 67–69%
F
A 85–89%
C 63–66%

Formal Examination Period

Auditing Courses
A student may register to audit certain courses at Trent
University. Permission of the instructor is required; it is
the student’s responsibility to obtain permission from the
course instructor to audit. Not all courses can be audited.
Courses taken for audit will not count for credit towards
the student’s degree program, nor will the student be
allowed to write final examinations or receive grades for
courses which are audited. Courses which are audited
will be recorded on the student’s transcript and the term
“AUD” will appear in lieu of a grade. Audit courses are
not considered in calculating full-time or part-time status;
audit courses will be considered for overload criteria.

Grading Criteria
The final grade in a course is based on at least some
of the following criteria: in-term oral and written
work, in-term or mid-year tests or examinations, final
examinations, practica, and community-based projects.
Normally, at least 25% of the grade in an undergraduate
half-credit course offered in the Fall/Winter academic
session must be determined and made available by the
final date for withdrawal. For full-year undergraduate
courses, at least 25% of the grade must normally be
determined and made available before the mid-year
review in January.
	 No final examination is worth more than 50% of the
final grade. Instructors are encouraged not to base final
grades entirely on tests and examinations.

Course Repeats

294

Students may repeat a course twice (three completions in
total when the original attempt is included). This includes
course equivalents attempted on a Letter of Permission
at another institution. All attempts will appear on the
students’ academic records, but no more than one
attempt will be assigned credit. The attempt with the
highest grade will be used to determine the cumulative
average.
	 Students enrolled in the Trent/Fleming School of Nursing
program will only be allowed to repeat one Nursing
theory course to raise their grade to 60% or higher and
one Nursing practice course to obtain a pass.

Policies & Administration

The following grades may also be used, but do not affect
a student’s average:
	AUD—Audit
	 INC—Incomplete—has permission to complete
	 INP—In Progress
	 NCR—No Credit Granted
	 NGR—No Grade Reported
	PRE—Pre-registered
	WD—Withdrawn
	PASS
	FAIL
The following grades may also be used and do affect a
student’s average:
	AG—Aegrotat Standing
	NTE—Nothing to Evaluate*
* In cases where a student has registered for a course,
but did not attend and/or submit work for evaluation, a
grade of NTE (Nothing to Evaluate) will be assigned. The
NTE grade carries the percentage value of zero and will be
used in Assessment of Academic Standing (p. 295).

Official Final Grades
Final grades are official 30 days after they have been
released by the Office of the Registrar. If errors in the
calculation or recording of grades come to light after the
grades have been released, all affected grades may be
recalculated and raised or lowered with the approval of
the appropriate dean. This process must be completed,
and corrected transcripts must be issued, however,
before the 30-day period has passed. Instructors and/or
departments are not permitted to release final grades.
Final examination marks can be released to students only
after final grades have been released by the Office of the
Registrar. There is no time limit to reopen a grade in a
case of academic dishonesty.

Transcripts
Copies of official grade transcripts will be issued only at
the written request of the student. In accordance with the
Access to Student Record Policy, the student’s signature
is required for the release of records. Transcripts may be
ordered in person at the Office of the Registrar, by mail,
or online through either myTrent or the Office of the
Registrar website. A fee must be paid for each copy of
a transcript. Transcripts will not be released for students
who have an outstanding financial obligation to the
University.
	 If someone other than the student is required to pick up
the transcript, the student must give that person a signed
authorization identifying the person and indicating that
the person is authorized to pick up the transcript. Photo
identification will be required.

Difficulties with Completion of Coursework

Academic Status

295

There are three options available to students who have
difficulties with the completion of their coursework for
reasons beyond their control: (1) if they cannot complete
their coursework before the end of the academic session,
they may request incomplete standing; (2) if they cannot
write the final examination in the course, and arranging
an alternate exam is not a reasonable option, they may
request aegrotat standing; (3) if they wish to withdraw
from the course altogether, but have missed the deadline
for withdrawal without academic penalty, they may
petition for late withdrawal. These three options are
described in detail below.

Assessment Average
A student’s academic status is determined by a session
average and/or by a cumulative average (see below).
The initial assessment average is calculated at the end of
the academic session in which students have completed
a minimum of three full-course equivalents for which
grades have been assigned. Thereafter, the cumulative
and session averages are calculated at the end of each
academic session. Transfer credits are not included in the
cumulative average or assessment average.

Policies & Administration

1. Incomplete Standing
Incomplete standing permits students to prearrange with
their instructor to submit any remaining work in a course
by a specified date after the end of the academic session.
Failure by students to organize their workload is not
considered adequate grounds for incomplete standing.
A petition for incomplete standing must be made to
the instructor and approved by the chair before the
department or program deadline (if there is one), but in
any case before submission of final grades to the Office of
the Registrar.
	 The instructor specifies the deadline for submission of
outstanding work and the grade which will be assigned if
the deadline is not met. The latest possible deadlines for
the submission of outstanding grades are:
•	 September 21, 2017 for courses completed in the
2017 Summer session
•	 February 26, 2018 for courses completed in the 2017
Fall term
•	 June 18, 2018 for courses completed in the 2018
Winter term
2. Aegrotat Standing
Students may, if eligible, be exempt from writing the final
examination in a course. A request for aegrotat standing
must be made to the instructor as soon as the relevant
circumstances are known and normally before the
scheduled examination time. Supporting documentation
must be provided. An aegrotat standing is granted only if
the student has completed the required term work with a
passing average. Aegrotat standing marks are determined
using a calculated final examination mark for the student
in question. The examination mark is calculated by adding
to the student’s term mark the class final examination
average minus the class term-work average.
3. Late Withdrawal
Late withdrawal is granted to students who have missed
the final date for withdrawal from courses but, for
reasons judged to be compelling, have been unable to
complete their coursework. A petition for late withdrawal
is made to the Committee on Undergraduate Petitions
through an academic advisor as soon as possible and
normally before the end of the academic session.

Session Average
The session average includes all courses in the current
session (Fall/Winter or Summer) for which a grade has
been assigned.
Cumulative Average
The cumulative average includes all courses for which a
grade has been assigned and excludes lower grades of
courses that have been repeated. Cumulative average is
used for the purposes of determining a student’s eligibility
to graduate and for the President’s and Dean’s Honour
Rolls.
Categories of Academic Status
There are five categories of academic status: (1) Good
Standing; (2) Probation; (3) Conditional Probation; (4)
Academic Suspension; and (5) Suspension—Academic
Dishonesty.
1. Good Standing
Students are in Good Standing if their cumulative
average is at least 60%.
2. Probation
Students are placed on Probation if their cumulative
average is 50–59.9% or if they are returning from
Academic Suspension.
	 Upon the next academic assessment, students will:
	 a) continue on Probation if their cumulative average
is 50–59.9% and their session average is above
49.9%;
	 b) have their Probation lifted if their cumulative
average is 60% or higher; or
	 c) be placed on Academic Suspension (see below) if
their cumulative average OR session average is less
than 50%.
3. Conditional Probation
Students who are accepted into the Fresh Start Program
after being granted a petition against suspension by
the Committee on Undergraduate Petitions will have
an academic status of Conditional Probation for one
calendar year. The student’s status will be reviewed at
the conclusion of each session (August for Summer
courses, April for Fall/Winter courses). Students must
achieve a minimum session average of at least 50% for
courses completed in the Summer session (if applicable)
and the Fall/Winter session or Suspension will be reimposed. If at the end of the Conditional Probation year

TRENT UNIVERSITY  2017–2018 Undergraduate Calendar | August 2017

4. Academic Suspension
Students are suspended from the University if their
cumulative average is less than 50%. Students who
had been on Probation are suspended if their session
average OR their cumulative average is less than 50%
upon the next academic assessment.
•	 First Academic Suspension: Students are suspended
from the University for one calendar year.
•	 Second Academic Suspension: If a student is
suspended a second time, the student will be
suspended from the University for one calendar year
(a second time).
•	 Debarment: If a student is suspended a third time,
the student will be debarred from the University for a
minimum of three calendar years.
For readmission to the University after a second Academic
Suspension or Debarment, students must provide
persuasive evidence that they are ready and able to
complete a degree program (see Readmission, p. 287).
5. Suspension—Academic Dishonesty
Students may be placed on suspension by the dean
for repeated violations of the Academic Integrity Policy
(see Academic Integrity Policy, p. 301). Appeals of the
dean’s decision should be made to the Special Appeals
Committee. Students seeking clarification on the appeals
process may consult an academic advisor or seek advice
from faculty members. There is no time limit to reopen a
grade in a case of academic dishonesty.
Continuing Post-secondary Studies during Academic
or Non-academic Suspension
Students who are on suspension will not be awarded
transfer credits for the duration of an academic or nonacademic suspension from Trent University. Studies
completed at another post-secondary institution during
the term of suspension may be considered as a basis for
readmission to the University, but will not be eligible for
transfer credit consideration.
Procedures for Students on Academic Suspension
Students who are placed on academic suspension may,
through an academic advisor, petition the Committee on
Undergraduate Petitions to have their status reconsidered.
If the petition is successful and they are accepted into
the Fresh Start Program, they will have their academic
standing changed to Conditional Probation. Fresh Start
students will be permitted to continue their studies at
a reduced course load under the supervision of their
academic advisor for the Fall/Winter session immediately
following placement on Academic Suspension. Students
may enrol in the Fresh Start Program one time only. In
some cases, the student may be allowed to return on
Probation.

Academic Petitions and Appeals
Students may appeal grades which they have received,
regulations which have caused them undue hardship,
the penalty of academic suspension, and penalties for
academic dishonesty. As a last resort, students may appeal
the results of previous petitions or appeals through a
special appeal.
Appeals of Grades on Term Work
Appeals of grades on term assignments and tests are
made to the course instructor and subsequently, if
necessary, to the chair of the department or program.
Students are advised to familiarize themselves with the
appeals policy of the department or program involved.
Appeals of Final Grades
Appeals of final grades are made in writing to the Office
of the Registrar. There is a fee for each appeal, which is
refunded if the grade is raised. The grade of a student
who is making an appeal cannot be lowered as a result of
that appeal.
	 Only the following work may be reassessed in appeals
of final grades:
•	 term-work not returned to students before the
submission of final grades to the Office of the
Registrar; and
•	 final examinations.
The deadlines for appeals of final grades are:
•	 November 10, 2017 for courses completed in the
2017 Summer session
•	 March 5, 2018 for courses completed in the 2017 Fall
term
•	 June 26, 2018 for courses completed in the 2018
Winter term
Students are informed of the results of appeals of final
grades as soon as possible after the appeal deadline but,
in any case, before the beginning of the next academic
session after the appeal deadline.
Appeals of Academic Regulations
Students who believe that specific academic regulations
have imposed undue hardship on them may petition
the application of the regulations to the Committee on

Summary Table
The table below summarizes the procedures for petitions
and appeals, indicating the appropriate situation for each
(“why”), the persons responsible for dealing with them
(“who”), and the deadlines for submission (“when”).
It is intended only as a convenient summary. Before
pursuing any of these options, students should consult
the appropriate section of the Calendar where the official
procedures and requirements are laid out in full.

Students registered in an undergraduate degree program
at Trent University may, with certain conditions, be
permitted to take undergraduate courses at other
universities as credits towards their Trent University
degree. Students must obtain a Letter of Permission from
the Office of the Registrar prior to registering in courses at
another university.
	 Only courses completed on a Letter of Permission
with a minimum grade of 60% will receive credit at
Trent University and will be recorded as a “Pass” on
the student’s record. Courses completed with a grade
between 50% and 59% will appear as “Pass - No Credit
Granted (NCR)” on the student’s record and will carry a
credit weight of zero. A failing grade (0%–49%) earned
on a Letter of Permission course will appear as a “Fail” on
the student’s record. Grades from courses completed on
a Letter of Permission will not be included in the session
or cumulative average. Courses taken on a Letter of
Permission will count toward cumulative credit attempts.
	 To obtain a Letter of Permission, students must be in
good academic standing and have an average of at least
60% on a minimum of 3.0 credits completed at Trent.
Deadlines for Letter of Permission requests are listed in the
Important Dates section (p. 6).
	 For more details about study at foreign universities, see
International Educational Opportunities p. 266).
Restrictions
•	 Students taking Summer courses at another postsecondary institution on a Letter of Permission may
not attempt more than 2.0 credits. Students may
take a maximum of 2.0 credits in a Summer session,
including courses at another university on a Letter of
Permission.
•	 No more than 5.0 credits may be completed on
a Letter of Permission. (For transfer students this
number may be lower, depending on how many
transfer credits they have received.)
•	 The total number of non-Trent credits in an Honours
program may not exceed 10.0. The total number
of non-Trent credits in a General program may not
exceed 7.5.
•	 5.0 of the last 7.0 credits obtained by a candidate for
a Trent University degree must be completed at Trent.
Notes
•	 Students who obtain a Letter of Permission should
register at the host university as a Visiting Student
rather than as a student in a degree program.
Students who register in a degree program will
jeopardize their registration status at Trent and will
need to apply for readmission. A Letter of Permission
issued to a student who subsequently transfers to
another post-secondary institution will be considered
invalid.
•	 Students who are granted a Letter of Permission
to complete the final course(s) of their program at
another university during the Fall/Winter session and
intend to graduate in the spring convocation must
provide grades to the Office of the Registrar in the

form of an official transcript by May 1 in order to
ensure that their names appear in the convocation
program and that their diplomas are printed for the
day of the ceremony. Students who are granted a
Letter of Permission to complete the final course(s)
of their program at another university during the
Summer session and intend to graduate in the Fall
must submit an official transcript to the Office of the
Registrar as soon as possible after completion of the
course for inclusion in the next Convocation Roll to
Senate.
Official Results of Letter of Permission
Courses approved for a Letter of Permission will appear
on a student’s Trent University transcript with a status of
INP (In Progress) at the time the Letter of Permission is
issued. Students are required to make arrangements to
have an official transcript forwarded to the Office of the
Registrar upon completion of the course. Once the official
transcript is received, the student’s record will be updated
with the completed course(s) and grade(s).
•	 If an official transcript, or evidence of non-enrolment,
is not forwarded to the Office of the Registrar within
60 calendar days of the end of the session specified
in the Letter of Permission, a grade of Fail will be
assigned.
•	 Transcripts forwarded in support of Admissions or
Financial Aid will not be considered official for Letter
of Permission completion.
Application Process for a Letter of Permission
There are different application procedures depending
upon where the student wishes to study. Check the

Letters of Permission

For students to graduate, Senate must confirm that they
have successfully completed the academic requirements
for their degree. Once students have graduated and are
free of all financial obligations to the University, they are
eligible to receive official transcripts, noting the successful
completion of their degree, and to receive their degree or
diploma.
	 In the year in which they intend to graduate, students
must submit an Application to Graduate form to the
Office of the Registrar through myTrent. The Office
of the Registrar will assess whether the students are
enrolled in the courses required to complete the academic
requirements for their degree, and will inform the
students by email of the result of this assessment. See the
Important Dates section (p. 6) for deadlines.
	 Once grades have been processed, the names of all
students who have successfully completed the academic
requirements for their degree are submitted to Senate
for approval. Only those students who have completed
the academic requirements for their degree prior to
convocation are allowed to participate in the convocation
ceremony.
	 Students who have successfully completed the academic
requirements for their degree, but who are not free of
financial obligations to the University, may participate in
the spring convocation ceremony but will not receive their
degree or diploma until their financial obligations are met.
Students who have successfully completed the academic
requirements for their degree too late for the spring
convocation ceremony will have their names submitted to
the next appropriate meeting of Senate and receive their
degree or diploma, provided they are free of all financial
obligations to the University. Students may participate at
the next spring convocation ceremony.
	 Once the degree, diploma or certificate is conferred,
the undergraduate academic record will not be modified
as a result of repeating, withdrawing from, or taking
additional courses. Academic standing notations will not
be removed. Final grades in courses completed during
the final term of study may be appealed as per the Final
Grade Appeal policy. Additional academic credentials such
as minors, specializations, emphases, or options may not
be added to a degree once it has been conferred. In a
circumstance in which an administrative error on the part
of the University is discovered after a credential has been
conferred, the error will be corrected as necessary.
	 This restriction does not preclude a student from
pursuing an Honours degree after the completion of a
General degree, or a second degree under the Second
Degree Regulations (p. 300). Academic dishonesty
transcript notations will be removed automatically five
years after the notation has been placed on the transcript,
or sooner with approval of the Vice-President (Academic)
as per the Academic Integrity Policy (p. 301).

trentu.ca/academicintegrity.
UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY
Part I: Application and Definitions
1.1	Application
This policy applies to students registered in undergraduate
courses in the Faculty of Arts and Science at Trent
University as well as to applicants to undergraduate
programs at the University.
1.2	Terminology
In this policy, “department” means undergraduate
departments, programs, and schools. “Chair” means
chairs and directors of undergraduate departments,
programs, and schools, or appointed designates. “Dean”
means the Deans of Arts & Science, Education, or
Nursing, and “Registrar” means University Registrar.
1.3	 Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is defined by the basic principles of
honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility (as
articulated by the International Center for Academic
Integrity, academicintegrity.org). These values serve as
the foundation for the development and acquisition of
knowledge and all members of the University community
are expected to uphold them. For students, adherence to
these fundamental values is essential for earning academic
credit in all courses, whether offered on- or off-campus,
online, or as placements, practicums or internships. Trent
University’s Academic Integrity website provides helpful
information on why integrity is important and how to
avoid integrity infractions (trentu.ca/academicintegrity).
1.4	 Academic Dishonesty
Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism and cheating,
is ultimately destructive of the values of the University.
Scholarly integrity is required of all members of the
University. Engaging in any form of academic dishonesty
or misconduct in order to obtain academic credit or
advantage of any kind is an offence under this policy.
1.5	 Plagiarism
Plagiarism is knowingly presenting words, ideas,
images, data, or any other form of work of another
person (including essays, theses, lab reports, projects,
assignments, presentations, and posters) in a way that
represents or could be reasonably seen to represent
the work as one’s own. “Knowingly” includes ought
reasonably to have known. Plagiarism includes failure
to acknowledge sources correctly and submitting
materials copied from the Internet without proper
acknowledgement of the source. Draft work submitted
for evaluation is subject to the same standard as final
work.

1.6	 Cheating
Cheating is dishonest academic conduct or attempted
dishonest academic conduct during tests or examinations
or in the preparation of any other coursework or in the
presentation of credentials for admission to the University
or one of its programs. Some common examples are:
•	 submitting one’s own original student work for
credit in more than one course (includes a course
being repeated) without the prior agreement of the
instructors involved
•	 bringing aids, including electronic aids, that have not
been authorized by the instructor into an examination
or test
•	 impersonating another individual or colluding in an
impersonation for an examination or test
•	 copying from one or more other individuals or
knowingly permitting one or more other individuals
to copy from one’s own test, examination paper, lab
report, or assignment
•	 collaborating with one or more other individuals
when collaborative work has not been expressly
authorized by the instructor
•	 communicating with one or more other students
during a test or examination
•	 purchasing or selling any piece of work for
submission, or facilitating the selling and purchasing
of such material
•	 submitting purchased material as one’s own work
•	 falsifying or tampering with results in laboratory
experiments or research assignments
•	 falsifying transcripts or tampering with documents
used to make decisions about admissions to the
University or one of its programs
•	 withholding transcripts or other required documents
at the time of application to the University
•	 submitting false or misrepresentative medical
certificates or other documentation in support
of requests for concessions on academic work or
deadlines
1.7	 Student to consult if in doubt
Students who have any doubt as to what might be
considered academic dishonesty in a particular course
should consult the instructor of the course to obtain
appropriate guidelines.

TRENT UNIVERSITY  2017–2018 Undergraduate Calendar | August 2017

301
Policies & Administration

Academic Integrity

2.1	 Minor or major offence
The penalty for a student who has been found to have
committed an academic offence will be based on whether
the offence is minor or major.
2.2	Penalties
First minor offence: The penalty for a first offence that
is a minor offence will be partial or total loss of marks on
the piece of academic work. The grade reduction shall,
at a minimum, lead to a failure on the piece of work. The
recommended penalty is a zero grade. There will be no
opportunity to resubmit the coursework, test, or exam.
Second minor or first major offence: The penalty for
a second minor offence or a first offence that is a major
offence will be a grade of zero on the piece of academic
work with no opportunity to resubmit, plus a transcript
notation (e.g., AHCL 1001H—Academic Dishonesty). A
reduced final grade or a final grade of zero in the course
may also be levied.
Subsequent offence, Suspension: The penalty for
any offence i) after two minor offences; or ii) after a
first offence that is a major offence; or iii) that is a major
offence where a minor offence is already on record will
be a period of suspension from the University (academic
status “Suspension—Academic Dishonesty”) ranging
from one term to two years in addition to a zero grade in
the course and an Academic Dishonesty notation for the
course. If a student, who is otherwise eligible to graduate,
has been suspended for academic dishonesty, the student
may not graduate until the period of the suspension has
been served.
Subsequent offence, Expulsion: The penalty for any
subsequent offence will be expulsion from the University.
2.3	 Extraordinary circumstances
The penalties above will be levied unless there are
extraordinary circumstances which justify a different
penalty.
2.4	 Factors to determine whether offence minor or
major
In deciding whether an offence is minor or major,
consideration will be given to the following factors:
•	 the extent of the dishonesty
•	 whether the act in question was deliberate or
whether the student ought reasonably to have known
•	 the importance of the work in question as a
component of the course or program
•	 the academic experience of the student
•	 any other relevant circumstances
These factors shall also be taken into consideration in
determining penalty where the usual penalty provides for
a range.
2.5	 Ineligibility for Honour Rolls
A student who has committed a major offence or
multiple offences is ineligible for the Dean’s Honour Roll
that academic year and the President’s Honour Roll at
graduation.

Part III: Procedures for Evaluation of Coursework and
Conduct during Tests and Exams
Note: All written communication to current students
pursuant to this policy will be to the student’s Trent email
account.
3.1	 Instructor investigates
The instructor will make reasonable inquiries to investigate
the circumstances of the matter. If the instructor has
reason to believe that a student has committed an
academic offence, the instructor will so inform the
student within a reasonable time and invite the student to
meet to discuss the matter.
3.2	 Instructor finds no academic dishonesty
If after meeting with the student and reviewing the
evidence the instructor is satisfied that no academic
dishonesty occurred, no further action will be taken by the
instructor unless new evidence comes to his/her attention.
3.3	 Instructor finds academic dishonesty, reports to
Chair
If, after meeting with the student (or if the student fails
to respond to the request for a meeting or does not
attend a prearranged meeting) the instructor decides
that academic dishonesty has occurred, the instructor will
prepare a report to the Chair. The report will summarize
the relevant facts and evidence, including the student’s
version of events if given. The report will additionally
state whether the instructor considers the offence to be
minor or major and the reasons therefore, as well as any
extraordinary circumstances that are evident in the case.
If the offence is considered to be minor, the instructor
will recommend a grade reduction (see 2.2). Copies of all
supporting documentation will be attached to the report.
The instructor will provide a copy of the report to the
student and to the Dean.
3.4	 Opportunity for comment by student
Should the student wish to add to or clarify the
information in the report, within seven days of the date
of the report, the student may request a meeting with the
Chair or send written comments to the Chair.
3.5	 Chair finds no academic dishonesty
The Chair will carefully review the report and comments, if
any. If the Chair is not satisfied that academic dishonesty
occurred, the Chair will inform the student in writing of
his/her decision, with a copy to the Dean, and no further
action will be taken unless new evidence is brought to the
Chair’s attention.
3.6	 Chair finds academic dishonesty, consults Office
of the Dean
If the Chair is satisfied that academic dishonesty occurred,
the Chair will first determine if the offence is minor or
major and the penalty that should be imposed. The
Chair will then inquire of the Office of the Dean whether
there is a record of any previous academic offence by the
student.

Part II: Penalties for Academic Offences on
Coursework, Tests, or Exams

3.8	 Limits of Chair’s authority
The Chair does not have authority to levy a penalty
exceeding a grade in the course of zero with the transcript
notation “Academic Dishonesty.”
3.9	 Timing of Chair’s decision

student within two weeks of receiving student comments
or, if no comments are provided, within two weeks of
receipt of the instructor report.
3.10 Appeal of Chair’s decision to the Dean
The student may appeal a decision by the Chair by writing
to the Dean setting out the grounds for appeal within
two weeks of receiving the Academic Dishonesty Form.
The Dean will normally respond to the appeal within two

3.11 Prior record or stronger penalty deemed
appropriate by Chair, Dean decides
If there is already a record of an academic offence(s) on
file for a student the Chair will forward the material to
the Dean who will decide the matter. The Chair may also
forward a case to the Dean for decision on an alleged
first major offence where the Chair deems that a penalty
stronger than he/she can render is appropriate. In the
latter case the Chair will set out the reasons for his/her
conclusion that a stronger penalty is appropriate.

Part IV: Procedures for Applications to the University
or One of its Programs

303

4.1	 Notice to Registrar
Where the alleged academic dishonesty involves falsifying,
misrepresenting, or withholding records for entry into the
University or one of its programs, the Registrar will be
informed.

Policies & Administration

3.7	 First offence, Chair decides
If there is no record on file of any previous academic
offence by the student the Chair will levy a penalty
accordingly. If, based on extraordinary circumstances,
the Chair decides to levy a penalty other than the usual
penalty, the Dean will be notified of the reasons for the
penalty. The Chair will send to the student an Academic
Dishonesty Form to inform the student in writing of the
decision and confirm that a record of the offence will be
filed in the department office and the Office of the Dean.

4.2	 Student notified
The Registrar will notify the student in writing of the
allegation and will invite the student to meet within a
reasonable time. If the student does not respond to the
request for a meeting or does not attend a prearranged
meeting, the Registrar will proceed to make a decision on
the basis of the evidence before him/her.
4.3	 Registrar decides
If, after reviewing the evidence, the Registrar is satisfied
that no academic dishonesty occurred, the Registrar will
inform the student in writing of his/her decision and no
further action will be taken by the Registrar unless new
evidence is brought to the Registrar’s attention.
	 If the Registrar is satisfied that academic dishonesty
has occurred, the Registrar will decide the appropriate
penalty and inform the student in writing of his/her
decision. A written record of the incident, along with the
documented evidence, will be kept on file at the Office of
the Registrar and the Office of the Dean if appropriate.
4.4	 Appeal of Registrar’s decision to Dean
The student may appeal the decision of the Registrar by
writing to the Dean setting out the grounds for appeal
within two weeks of notification of the Registrar’s
decision. The Dean will normally respond to the appeal
within two weeks of receiving the appeal.

3.12 Note on Tests and Exams
Where an allegation of academic dishonesty arises during
a test or examination, the responsible invigilator will
collect the available evidence and, if he/she is not the
course instructor, will notify the course instructor who will
proceed as detailed above.

TRENT UNIVERSITY  2017–2018 Undergraduate Calendar | August 2017

5.1	 Withdrawal from courses or the University
Upon receipt of the instructor’s report, the Office of the
Dean will request that the Office of the Registrar put a
registration hold on the course thereby preventing the
student from withdrawing. If the student had withdrawn
subsequent to a request to meet with the instructor and
prior to receiving the instructor’s report, the student will
be re-enrolled in the course. The registration hold will
remain in place unless it is determined that no infraction
of the policy has taken place. In that case, the Office of
the Dean will request that the registration hold and all
records associated with it be removed.
	 A student will not be permitted to formally withdraw
from the University while under investigation for academic
dishonesty.
5.2	 Final Appeal
The student may appeal a decision of the Dean to the
Special Appeals Committee of the University within four
weeks of notification of the decision. The decision of the
Special Appeals Committee is final within the University.
5.3	 Clarification of appeals procedure
Students seeking clarification of the appeals process may
consult with their Academic Advisor. For guidance on the
appeals procedures at the University see the “Petitions
and Appeals” section of the Calendar and the Special
Appeals website.

5.9	 Removal of transcript notations
“Academic Dishonesty” transcript notations will be
automatically removed five years after the notation has
been placed on a transcript. If a student wishes to have
the transcript notation removed sooner, an application
can be made in writing to the Vice-President (Academic).
The letter should explain the reason for the request, what
the student has learned from the experience, and what
he/she has done to ensure violations of academic integrity
will not occur again. Such applications may not be
initiated before two years have passed. Zero grades and
notations of expulsion for Academic Dishonesty will not
be removed from the transcript.
5.10 Report on Academic Offences
A summary of academic offences (setting out the nature
of each offence and the penalty) will be prepared
by the Dean annually, published on an Academic
Integrity website, and circulated to Senate each year for
information.
5.11 Participation of others in the appeal process
As long as advance notice is given, students who wish to
do so may bring one support person to a meeting with
the course instructor, Chair or Dean. That person will not
be permitted to participate in the discussion.

5.4	 Privacy protection
In accordance with privacy legislation, personal
information gathered under this policy will only be shared
among university personnel on a need to know basis.
5.5	 Other allegations of academic dishonesty
Any other allegations of academic dishonesty may be
made in writing to the Dean. The Dean will determine the
appropriate procedure to be followed.
5.6	 No permanent record of dropped allegations
If it is determined that allegations are not supported by
sufficient evidence, no permanent record of the incident
will be kept on file at the offices of the department,
Registrar, or Dean.
5.7	 Course completion or withdrawal is not a stay of
proceedings
A student’s completion of a course or withdrawal from
a course, program, or the University does not stay or
prevent proceedings for academic dishonesty under
this policy. Further, penalties for academic dishonesty
determined under this policy will appear as appropriate
on the student’s record, including the student’s transcript,
despite any such course completion or withdrawal.
5.8	 Rescinding of degree
If an academic integrity violation is discovered after the
degree has been awarded, the University retains the right
to rescind the degree.

Payment of Fees

Fees are collected by the Student Accounts Office,
Financial Services. Approved fees and complete details,
including exact dates and deadlines, are posted online.
Fees for registered students will be billed in August for the
Fall term and November for the Winter term. Statements
and invoice details are available on the portal under the
Finance section. To assist new students in their financial
planning, fee schedules for the current academic year
are posted at trentu.ca/financialservices/tuitionfees for
reference.

Deadlines: trentu.ca/financialservices/deadlines.php.
Payment is due in full for the Fall term on September 1
and due in full for the Winter term on January 9. Students
registering after payment deadlines will be required to pay
their fees upon registration. Fees for students registered
for the Summer session are due upon registration. Please
see the website for all payment deadline details.
	 Outstanding library fines are to be settled with the
Library. Contact either Library location for available
payment options. Departmental charges added to
accounts for laboratory fees, field trips, etc., as advised by
course instructors, are to be paid in the term during which
they are charged.

Student Financial Responsibilities
Upon registering in a course, students accept
responsibility for all financial obligations with the
University regardless of how the fees are being funded
(e.g., RESPs, government loans). It is also the responsibility
of students to be aware of all financial and academic
deadlines and to ensure they are officially registered in
their courses through myTrent. Credit will not be issued
for dropped courses once financial deadlines have passed.
Payments will be applied to any balance owing from
prior sessions before being applied to current session
fees. Students who register for courses but do not attend
classes are still responsible for all fees.
Addresses for Student Accounts Purposes
It is each student’s responsibility to ensure that the
University has a valid mailing address for student fees,
income tax receipts, and refund purposes. If students
change their address on myTrent, all mailings will be
distributed to this address.
Campus Card
The campus card is issued to students at the beginning
of the term of study for which they have completed
registration. To utilize full card benefits, students must
be eligible financially by satisfying the minimum payment
requirements. Winter term students will receive their
campus cards at the beginning of Winter term.
Confidentiality of Student Fee Information
The handling of all personal information by the University
is governed by the Freedom of Information and Protection
of Privacy Act. All information regarding student fees
is treated as confidential and will normally only be
released to individual students. In cases where sponsoring
government and private agencies and organizations or
individuals are paying fees on the student’s behalf, the
student may wish to waive the right of privacy and allow
the University to release information about the status of
fees to avoid any interruption in payment. To ensure that
the necessary fee information is available to sponsoring
agencies, etc., students must complete the Release of
Information Form, found under Forms on the Academic
tab in myTrent.

Payment Methods
Current payment methods are summarized here:
trentu.ca/financialservices/paymentfees/payment.php
Advance Payments
A non-refundable tuition payment (amounts vary based
on number of registered credits and program) is due in
June for all students. Students receiving OSAP are also
responsible for paying the advance payment of tuition
by the deadline. Peterborough students in residence are
required to pay a separate deposit; please check with
Housing Services (p. 315; trentu.ca/housing) for details
and deadline. Advance payments are applied to student
accounts as payment towards the registration and
residence/dining fees. Trent University Durham students
in residences should check trentu.ca/durham/housing for
Durham-specific information.
Late Payments
A late payment fee will be levied to all
accounts if payment is not made by any fee
deadline for any academic session. Please visit
trentu.ca/financialservices/paymentfees/deadlines.php for
a list of due dates.
Interest
Daily interest charges will apply to all balances
outstanding after the payment due date and will
be added on the first day of each month until the
outstanding balance is paid in full. Visit the Financial
Services website for more information.
Dishonoured Payments
There is a fee for any payment which is returned or
dishonoured (insufficient funds). The University reserves
the right to restrict students to a particular payment
method to reduce the risk of returned payments.

the fee payment, must be paid to Trent University by
all international students in order to provide this health
insurance coverage.

Withdrawal from the University and
Refund of Fees

Students accept financial responsibility for fees associated
with all registered courses at the time they complete
registration. Students wishing to submit a financial appeal
because of a serious, documented medical illness, or
the death of an immediate family member, which led
to the dropping of courses or full withdrawal, may do
so in writing for a fee. The financial appeal should be
submitted to the manager of Accounting Operations.
Such cases must be documented completely. Financial
appeals will not be considered when a condition or illness
pre-existed the normal drop date or existed at the time
of registration. Failure to plan financially for personal and
educational commitments is not a basis for a financial
appeal. The fee must be submitted with the appeal.
Financial appeals will only be considered in writing with
supporting documentation from the student. A successful
academic appeal (e.g., CUP petition for late withdrawal)
does not mean a student has grounds for a successful
financial appeal. Written documentation should include
references from any sources which can substantiate a
student’s personal situation.
	 Students will be notified of the decision in writing
within 60 days of submission. The last date for submission
of a financial appeal for an academic term is six months
from the end of the term being appealed. An academic
appeal is not the same as a financial appeal (see Academic
Appeals for details, p. 296). A financial appeal will affect
a student’s account balance. If account balances remain
unpaid, transcripts will not be released.

Unpaid Student Accounts
Students who have not paid their accounts in full will
not be permitted to register for the next session. Access
to myTrent will be restricted and grades, transcripts, and
degree and diploma certificates will not be released until
the financial obligations have been settled fully. Letter
requests made to the Office of the Registrar will be
subject to review and authorization by Financial Services
(Student Accounts). Education students will not have
credentials recommended to the Ontario College of
Teachers if a balance remains outstanding.
	 Unpaid accounts of students who are no longer
registered with the University will be placed with a
collection agency and the students will be unable to
register for any further courses until the outstanding
balance has been paid. Trent University reserves the right
to use any legal means to reclaim delinquent balances.
	 The University also reserves the right to request a prepayment of the fees prior to registration for any account
that has been delinquent.

program designed to foster and reward high academic
achievement among its students. All new entering
students with a final admission average of 80% or higher
will be considered for one of Trent University’s Renewable
Entrance Scholarships. In-course students who did not
receive an entrance scholarship, and who achieve an
average of 85% in 5.0 Trent University credits during
an academic year, will be considered for an in-course
scholarship; please see further details on the website.
	 All University scholarships may be held in conjunction
with scholarships awarded by outside agencies when
the conditions of the latter permit; however, a student
may not receive funds from more than one major Trent
University scholarship in an academic year.
	 Students with documented disabilities may be eligible
to receive scholarships based on a reduced course load.
Please contact the Student Accessibility Services Office for
details (p. 326).
Externally Awarded Scholarships
A number of scholarships (and bursaries) are awarded by
organizations outside the University. Some corporations
have special programs for dependents of their employees.
Students should consult their parents, secondary school
guidance counsellors, and applicable websites to search
for external awards. Some links to externally awarded
scholarships are listed on the Financial Aid web page
under Scholarships.
Prestigious Scholarships
Trent’s Prestigious Scholarships include the Champlain
Scholarship, the Board of Governors’ Leadership
Scholarship, the Michael Treadwell Scholarship, the
Canada-Wide Science Fair Scholarship, and the Trent
University Special Admissions Scholarship. These are
renewable scholarships awarded to new students entering
the first year of study who have displayed exceptional
academic and extracurricular achievement, and who
are judged likely to make a significant contribution to
the life of the University. Students must apply for these
scholarships; applications are usually available beginning
in January each year. Full details and application deadlines
can be found on the Financial Aid website under
Scholarships. Previous winners of these scholarships have
normally had an average of at least 90%. The winners are
announced by early May each year.
	 Students with a final entrance average of 80% or
higher who did not apply, or are not eligible, for a
Prestigious Scholarship will automatically be considered
for a Trent University National Renewable Entrance
Scholarship.

Trent University National Renewable Entrance
Scholarships
These scholarships are awarded to students entering their
first year at Trent with a final admission average of 80%
or higher, who are not in receipt of a Prestigious or other
Trent University entrance scholarship. Students entering

must maintain an 80% average in 5.0 Trent University
credits each academic year. Full details are available on
the Scholarships page of the Financial Aid web site under
Entrance Scholarships & Full Tuition.
In-Course Scholarships
Undergraduate students who did not receive a renewable
entrance scholarship are automatically considered for an
in-course scholarship at the end of their first year. Unless
specifically noted, these scholarships do not require
an application. Students already receiving a renewable
entrance scholarship are not eligible to receive an incourse scholarship. These scholarships are listed at
trentu.ca/financialaid.
	 Students who achieve an 85% average in 5.0 Trent
University credits during the previous academic year are
eligible for an in-course scholarship of $1,000; students
with an average of 90% or higher are eligible for a
scholarship of $2,000.
International Scholarships
For scholarships available to international visa students,
please visit the website. They require a letter of application
to Trent International accompanied by an application

certified evidence of proficiency in English (see English
Proficiency Requirements under Admissions, p. 281), and
three letters of reference (including two from current or
former teachers). For scholarships designated for United
World Colleges or advertised through Canadian Education
Centres abroad, application should be made directly
to the appropriate United World College or Canadian
Education Centre. Holders of renewable scholarships must
remain in good academic standing for their scholarships
to be renewed.

GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED
Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP)
The province of Ontario and the government of Canada
provide integrated assistance programs to Ontario
residents attending university through the Ontario Student
Assistance Program (OSAP). To qualify for OSAP, students
must be Canadian Citizens, Permanent Residents, or
Protected Persons, and be enrolled in at least 60% of
a full course load (40% for students with permanent
disabilities who are registered with Student Accessibility
Services). The purpose of the OSAP program is to assist
students when the financial resources available to them
from parents, spouses, summer employment, or other
sources are insufficient to meet educational costs.
	 The OSAP funding year starts in September of each
year. A new application is required for each funding year.
Students may apply for funding on the OSAP website at
ontario.ca/osap. Students should apply for OSAP at least
four to six weeks before the start of their study session
to ensure that funding will be available when they begin
their studies.
Part-Time Canada Student Loans and Grants
Part-time students (registered in less than 60% of a
full course load) with demonstrated financial need may
qualify for a study grant or a Canada part-time student
loan. Visit the OSAP website for application details
ontario.ca/osap.
Students from Outside Ontario
Canadian students from outside Ontario who require
financial aid should consult with officials in their
home province to apply for provincial government
student aid. Links to out-of-province government loan
programs can be found on the Financial Aid website:
trentu.ca/financialaid. Students from foreign countries,
including the US, are strongly urged to consult with
educational authorities and sponsoring agencies in their
home country. Trent International (TI) provides information
regarding financial programs for international students.

Bursary for Students with Disabilities
Sponsored by the province of Ontario and the
government of Canada, Bursaries for Students with
Disabilities (BSWD) are available to students with
a financial need who require assistive devices for
educational purposes. Applications are available at the
Student Accessibility Services Office (p. 326).
Trent Work Study Program (TWSP)
The Trent work study program provides part-time jobs on
campus during the study period for full-time Canadian
students (minimum 60% of a full course load) whose
financial needs are not met through the OSAP programs
or the provincial government student assistance program
of their home province. Further information is available on
the Financial Aid website or the Career Centre website at
trentu.ca/careers.
Ontario Student Opportunity Trust Fund (OSOTF) &
Ontario Trust for Student Support (OTSS)
In 1996-1997 the province of Ontario established the
Ontario Student Opportunity Trust Fund to assist students
with a financial need. Half of this endowed fund is
provided by the province and half has been provided
through fundraising by the University. Annual proceeds
from investment earnings are available in the form of
in-course bursaries to Ontario residents. A second phase
of OSOTF was introduced in 2003. In some instances,
academic excellence as well as financial need will be a
determining factor. All bursaries and awards established
or modified since 1996-1997 must adhere to the OSOTF
guidelines listed below. In 2005 the province of Ontario
established the OTSS matching gift program to replace
the OSOTF program. The OSOTF guidelines noted above
apply also to bursaries and awards established through
the generosity of donors and matching OTSS funds.
Eligibility Guidelines:
Students must be Ontario residents to receive OSOTF
and OTSS bursaries and awards. To qualify for provincial
residency: prior to the beginning of their current full-time
post-secondary study session, students or their parents
or their spouses must have lived in Ontario for at least
12 consecutive months without being full-time postsecondary students.
	 Students must demonstrate financial need and be in
receipt of OSAP to qualify for OSOTF and OTSS bursaries
and awards. Eligible students may apply for OSOTF and
OTSS bursaries using the General Bursary application
available on the Financial Aid website.

Financial Aid offices. A few externally-funded bursaries
are administered through the Trent University Financial Aid
Office. Details and applications are posted on the Financial
Aid web page.

Awards
Financial assistance through Trent University’s award
program is designed to acknowledge those students with
outstanding academic qualifications and proven financial
need. Many of these awards are made possible through
the Ontario Student Opportunity Trust Fund established by
the province of Ontario in 1996-97; a second phase was
introduced in 2003 (p. 313). The trust fund represents
an endowment fund. Annual proceeds from investment
earnings are available in the form of awards to Ontario
residents enrolled in full-time or part-time undergraduate
or graduate studies. Students may apply for OSOTF and

In Peterborough, the colleges of Trent University offer their
own unique identities with a rich array of opportunities for
intellectual, cultural, and social life. Through membership
in a specific college, each student becomes part of a
smaller community within the larger university, which
provides an important sense of belonging. Founded on the
principle of interdisciplinary learning, the colleges promote
dialogue about important social issues such as social justice,
environmental sustainability, Canada’s Indigenous peoples,
international relationships, art and culture, and the health of
individuals across the lifespan. Each college is also home to a
unique mixture of academic departments, student services,
living learning communities, and places to socialize.
	 Located within each college office are both peer-based
and professional supports to assist with a wide variety of
student needs, including help with accessing student services
and campus resources, navigating degree requirements,
assistance with course selection, and learning about campus
involvement opportunities. Students are encouraged to use
these services as a first point of contact for any circumstance,
including mental and physical health, career directions,
learning skills, and clarifying long-term goals.
	 By getting elected to the student-run college cabinets,
members of the colleges have the opportunity to take on
additional leadership roles, including working closely with
college staff and the general membership to plan programs
and activities according to the interests of the community.
Promoting student-faculty interactions, acknowledging
accomplishments, building friendships, and helping
members find inspiration are all core objectives of these
activities. Cabinets also provide student representation on a
large number of institutional decision-making committees,
including Senate, budget committees, and advisory groups
on strategic directions.
	 College prizes (p. 313) honour academic excellence and
contributions to the life of the college. Each college plays a
key role in helping its members develop an intentional plan
for learning outside of the classroom so that students are
well-rounded, active citizens upon graduation. Involvement
in co-curricular learning within the colleges helps to build
skills that are well matched to what employers seek in
prospective workers.
	 Each college includes a dining hall, classrooms, faculty
and administrative offices, lounges and common spaces,
and residences for students who live on campus. The
majority of members of each college live in one of
Peterborough’s friendly neighbourhoods or commute from
outside of the city. All students, regardless of where they
live, are encouraged to participate equally in their college’s
community, and to make use of the services and facilities.

Academic Skills Instructor
D. Capell, BA (Carleton College), MA (Rutgers)
Named in honour of the noted author, botanist, and
pioneer settler of the Peterborough area, Catharine
Parr Traill College is one of the founding colleges of
Trent University. Traill College is an active community,
situated beautifully on a drumlin overlooking central
Peterborough, and it plays a unique role in connecting
Trent to the larger Peterborough community. Traill College
is the home for several of Trent University’s graduate
programs in the humanities and social sciences. In 2008,
it became the University’s only graduate studies college,
serving all graduate students in all disciplines. Although
primarily a graduate studies college, Traill retains its
undergraduate roots. Many undergraduate courses
continue to be taught at the college and the offices for
the departments of Canadian Studies, Cultural Studies,
and English Literature continue to be located there.
	 Space within the college’s historically significant
buildings and the modern Wallis Hall has been converted
into office space for graduate students and faculty, as
well as a few apartments for graduate students. Bagnani
Hall provides state-of-the-art teaching facilities as well as
the elegant Bagnani Room for small academic and social
functions. The ground floor of Scott House has also been
renovated to provide facilities in support of the graduate
programs and undergraduate teaching. Other college
facilities include Junior and Senior Common Rooms,
computer labs, the Trend (the college gastropub), and
student gathering space.
	 The intellectual life of the college is supplemented
by a wide range of cultural events and professional
development activities, including development workshops,
visiting speakers, guest lecturers, and visiting Fellows
from other universities. These events give members of
the college the opportunity to meet informally with
visiting scholars and professionals from a variety of
backgrounds. Traill is also home to the Thomas H. B.
Symons Graduate Seminar Series, the Writers Reading
series, open mic, poetry readings, and trivia nights in the
Trend. The excellent facilities and quiet atmosphere of
the college offer a comfortable working environment for
both students and faculty. Regular bus service connects
the college with the Symons Campus, and Traill’s close
proximity to downtown Peterborough provides easy
access to the Peterborough Public Library, art galleries,
movie theatres, live concerts, churches, restaurants, pubs,
and more.

Named in honour of the French explorer Samuel de
Champlain, the college is situated directly on the banks
of the Otonabee River. Discovery, adventure, reflection
and engagement (D.A.R.E.) is the spirit of this college
and a tribute to the history to that continues to shape
our community. These buildings were part of the original
design of the Symons Campus by master architect Ron
Thom, and features the Great Hall, a student pub, and
a locally sourced organic café. Active living and concern
for international perspectives are just two of the many
important aspects of the Champlain College culture.
	 Champlain is home to the departments of International
Development Studies, Political Studies, and Trent
International. In addition, Trent Students for Literacy, the
Trent International Students’ Association, the Trent Global
Living Community, and the Active Living Community are
located here. The Trent University Faculty Association,
Alumni Affairs, and B!KE at Trent, which is a do-it-yourself
bicycle repair shop, are also found at Champlain.
	 The college’s two residential quads are divided into
staircases with five bedrooms clustered on each floor
(a mixture of singles and doubles). Some students are
housed in facilities managed by the University but located
off campus, known as the Champlain Annex. All members
of the college, including those who live off campus in
private homes, are welcome to use the common rooms,
the music practice room, the Ceilie (a licensed pub), the
Junior Common Room, the Morton Reading Room, and
several group study spaces.

Named in honour of Flora McCrea Eaton, a native
of Omemee and one of the original sponsors of the
University, the college has a creative energy, a passion
for our local community, and a commitment to selfexpression. Nestled against a tree-covered drumlin, the
building houses student lounges, a dining hall, a music
library and pianos, and is home to both Spiritual Affairs
and Conference Services. A love of words, language,
social justice, and big ideas is part of our tradition.
	 The residential wings and Commons Block enclose an
outdoor quadrangle. For those who live in residence,
there are a total of 214 single occupancy bedrooms, 5
apartments reserved mostly for upper-year students, and
12 double occupancy bedrooms, accommodating both
men and women in a co-ed environment. The college
houses the departmental offices of Ancient History
& Classics, History, French & Francophone Studies,
Philosophy, Gender & Women’s Studies, Social Work, and
the offices of the deans of Social Sciences, Humanities,
and Science.
	 The Living Learning Communities within the college
include Expressions, and Leadership & Civic Engagement.
Notable common areas include the Junior Common
Room, the Pit, the LEC Cafeteria, a music room, and a TV

Policies & Administration

The college’s buildings range along a cedar ridge
overlooking the Otonabee River from which the college
derives its name. In Ojibwe, Otonabee means “river that
beats like a heart,” which symbolizes the way this college
looks to the horizon, and imagines how we can keep up
with change in our fast-paced lives while still honouring
our hearts. Through exploring how people interact with
the world, we are curious about human sciences and
environmental sciences. Whether it is understanding
human rights, caring for people who are sick, or
educating the next generation, this is a place where
everyone belongs.
	 Physically connected to the college building on the west
is the Science Complex, and spiritually connected to the
east is the DNA Building. Otonabee is home to the School
of Education and the departments of Sociology and
Computing & Information Systems. Anthropology, Biology,
Forensic Science, the Trent-Fleming School of Nursing,
and Psychology are also connected to the college in the
DNA and Life Health Sciences Building. In addition, here
Otonabee houses the Centre for Academic Testing and
the Centre for Human Rights, Equity & Accessibility.
	 Some notable spaces in the college include a Sociology
resource room, the OC Commons, and Wenjack Theatre.
Nearby are the Archaeology Centre, Mackenzie House,
and a wildlife sanctuary with walking and ski trails.
Eight houses, connected by an interior walkway called
the Street, make up Otonabee’s residence. Each house
contains single, double, and a few triple occupancy
bedrooms; a kitchenette; and a commons area. The
Otonabee Quad, with a lovely green space and picnic
tables, is located behind the School of Education
offices and can be accessed from the basement level.
All students, regardless of whether they live on or off
campus, are welcome to participate in the life of the
college.

Opened in 2004, the college is named in honour of
the University’s eighth chancellor: author, broadcaster,
columnist, and champion of literacy Peter Gzowski
(1934–2002). Located in the building called Enweying,
which is the Anishnaabe word for “the way we speak
together,” the college is animated by discussion and
a deep respect for each other that is at the heart of
our community. Through the pursuit of sustainability,
the exploration of marketplaces and numbers, and the
honouring of Indigenous traditions, we explore the world
and the intersection of many different fields of study.
While research is embedded in every part of the university,
we provide a special home for the process of asking
new questions about the world and learning to find the
answers.
	 Academic departments housed in Gzowski College
include Mathematics, Indigenous Studies, Economics,
Business Administration, and the Office of Research.
Reflective of the idea of integrating all peoples together,
Enweying has space in our Atrium (the common area
between the lecture halls) for a variety of special events.
As home to First People’s House of Learning, other unique
spaces in the building include the Nozhem Performance
Space, the Ernie and Florence Benedict Gathering Space,
and close proximity to the Tipi.
	 The four elements of the First Peoples are integrated
through the distinctive architecture of the building,
represented by the colours of the medicine wheel.
Gzowski College is adjacent to the Otonabee River
and has 250 single occupancy residence rooms for
undergraduate students in traditional-style residence
hallways.

Academic Advising

Alumni Association

trentu.ca/advising

trentu.ca/alumni

Academic advisors help students clarify their academic
goals, decide which courses to take, understand academic
regulations, connect with the services they need and,
ultimately, take charge of their own education. It is
recommended that students meet with an academic
advisor for assistance in planning their academic program.
Students who find themselves in difficulty with the
academic regulations and/or degree requirements of the
University should consult an academic advisor for advice.
Academic advisors are available in each of the colleges on
the Peterborough Symons and Traill campuses and at the
Trent University Durham campus. Advisors are available
throughout the year, by appointment, and during dropin hours. Information about booking appointments and
drop-in hours can be found on the advising website.
Students can also consult with departments concerning
discipline-specific questions.

Studying at Trent University is an exciting and important
time in a student’s life, but it is just one phase in the
lifelong relationship that the Alumni Association fosters
and encourages. Trent’s alumni remain informed,
interested, and involved long after graduation day. Alumni
House is a popular facility for many University events, as
well as a destination for returning alumni, particularly
on Homecoming Weekend each year. Chapters across
Canada and overseas provide opportunities for Trent
alumni to meet in their home communities, and recent
graduates help represent the University to secondary
school students. Alumni are eligible for discounts at the
University Bookstore and Athletics Centre, given access to
library services, and can receive special rates for home and
auto insurance. Children of alumni may qualify for special
scholarships to Trent.

Academic Skills
trentu.ca/academicskills
Academic Skills instructors teach writing and study skills to
undergraduate and graduate students through individual
and group instruction. In-person and online appointments
give students the opportunity to discuss academic work
in progress or to learn valuable skills such as critical
reading and thinking, time management, clear writing
and grammar, oral presentation strategies, research
and citation, listening and note-taking, essay and lab
writing, exam preparation techniques, and mathematics.
An Academic Skills instructor is located in each college
office. In addition, Academic Skills offers extensive online
resources and publications on its web page.

Current students and recent graduates are encouraged
to apply to the Life After Trent: Mentoring Program, for
an opportunity to be matched with prominent alumni or
Peterborough community leaders for mentoring sessions
during the Winter term.

Student Transitions & Careers
trentu.ca/careers

Trent Central Student Association (TCSA)
trentcentral.ca
The Trent Central Student Association (TCSA) is the
student union that represents all undergraduate students
at Trent University in Peterborough. As a member of
the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), the TCSA
is committed to bringing about necessary educational,
administrative, and/or legislative changes in those areas
affecting students by representing the interests of its
members to all levels of government and university
administration. The TCSA is governed by a Board of
Directors made up of representatives from each college
cabinet, as well as an executive committee and equity
commissioners elected annually from the membership at
large.
	 In addition to its advocacy and lobbying efforts, the
TCSA also provides a variety of services for its members
including a consignment used book service; GO ticket
sales; a free student day planner; a student discount
map; ATM machines; international student identity cards;
administration of Trent Transit; and a Student Benefits
Plan. The TCSA also organizes social events, concerts,
guest speakers, and more. It supports and sponsors more
than 100 student clubs, groups, and societies on campus,
and it works continually to improve and expand the
scope of its advocacy, activities, and programs. Students
are encouraged to communicate ideas and opinions to
their elected representatives on the Board of Directors,
to participate and become involved in the activities of
the TCSA, and to exercise their voting and membership
privileges.

The Office of Student Transitions and Careers offers
programming, supports, and resources to students in the
areas of orientation, campus engagement, leadership,
peer guidance, and career development. Housed within
the Office of Student Transitions and Careers, the Career
Centre is the on-campus and online resource to help
undergraduate and graduate students plan their future
careers and find employment—it is never too early to get
started. The Career Centre’s online resources, including a
student job board, a career guide, and degree tip sheets,
are available year-round at all campuses. Career and
employment workshops on topics like resumes, interview
skills, career planning, and career assessment are held

build transferrable skills on campus, including Orientation
Week, the Impact Leadership program, and the CoCurricular Record. The Co-Curricular Record is an official
Trent document acknowledging student accomplishments
that occur outside the classroom and are not for academic
degree credit. Student leadership positions, awards,
workshops, and other events can be considered for

The Counselling Centre provides individual, group, and
crisis counselling to all full- and part-time students. Staff
are committed to providing confidential services that
respect the dignity and value of all people regardless of
age, gender, ethnicity, physical qualities, sexual identity,
and ability. Many students seek support for specific
concerns related to anxiety, depression, grief, identity,
and relationship challenges, while other students come
with less defined difficulties like low motivation, poor selfimage/esteem, stress, loneliness, and adjustment issues.
Referrals within Peterborough or the Durham region can
be arranged as appropriate. Limited psychiatric services
are also available to Peterborough students.

Student Accessibility Services
Peterborough: trentu.ca/sas
Durham: trentu.ca/durham/accessibility

Student Health Services
trentu.ca/healthservices
Student Health Services provides primary health care to
all current students. A full range of confidential medical
services is available (see the website for hours and
details on available services). All clinics require booked
appointments. Health cards and student cards must
be presented at every visit to Health Services. Ontario
residents must have a current Ontario Health Insurance
Plan (OHIP) card. For students from another province,
that province’s health insurance is accepted as equivalent.
International students require University Health Insurance
Plan (UHIP) coverage (or equivalent) and should contact
Trent International for details.

The TCSA Student Benefits Plan offers full-year extended
health and dental coverage to all eligible students;
students that are registered in 1.5 or more credits are
automatically enrolled and charged the Benefits Plan fee.
Any undergraduate student in less than 1.5 credits may
opt into the plan by the deadlines found on the TCSA
website. For reasons of personal information and privacy
protection, the TCSA can discuss information pertaining
to an individual’s status on the plan only with the plan
holder.
	 Students are encouraged to contact the TCSA or visit
the website to learn more about the Benefits Plan options
and confirm opt-out or opt-in deadlines as soon as they
arrive on campus. It is each student’s responsibility to
meet all deadlines associated with the Student Benefits
Plan. Students are given an opportunity to waive (opt
out of) the Benefits Plan if they have existing comparable
alternative coverage. In order to opt out and be
reimbursed the mandatory fee, eligible students must
complete an online opt-out form before the deadline. This
deadline is firm and will be posted each year on the TCSA
website, by email, and in the TCSA Agenda.
	 Students who have waived their benefits under the plan
can opt back in if they lose their alternative coverage;
students must opt into the plan within 30 days of losing
alternative coverage. The Student Benefits Plan also offers
students the option to add a spouse and/or dependents
to their plan during the opt-out/opt-in periods each year.
Coverage begins on September 1, 2017 and ends on
August 31, 2018.
